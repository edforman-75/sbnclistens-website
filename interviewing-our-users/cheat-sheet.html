        <h2>THE 3 RULES</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>LISTEN 80%, TALK 20%</strong> - Let them do most of the talking</li>
            <li><strong>BE GENUINELY CURIOUS</strong> - Not interrogating, just interested</li>
            <li><strong>MAKE IT SAFE</strong> - Encourage honest feedback, even negative</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>THE STRUCTURE (15 min total)</h2>

    <h3>1. INTRODUCTION (2 min)</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "Thank you for speaking with me. I'm researching the SBNC website experience. No right/wrong answers. Your honest feedback helps us improve.
        <br><br>
        <strong>I'd like to record this conversation so we can transcribe and review it accurately. The recording will only be used by our team. Your name won't be attached to quotes. And if you'd prefer complete anonymity, just let me know. Is it okay if I record?</strong>
        <br><br>
        [Get clear YES before starting]
        <br><br>
        15 minutes total. Questions before we start?"
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>→ START RECORDING ONCE THEY CONSENT</strong></p>

    <h3>2. WARM-UP (2 min)</h3>
    <p><strong>Grounding questions first:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>How long in Santa Barbara?</li>
        <li>When did you join/hear about SBNC?</li>
        <li>What attracted you to the club?</li>
        <li>How would you describe SBNC to someone new to SB?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>For recent members (joined last 6-12 months):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>How did you first find out about SBNC?</li>
        <li>Walk me through trying to join - what did you do?</li>
        <li>What was that experience like?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Then:</strong> How did you first hear about/visit the website?</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Don't only interview super-engaged members! Seek out:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inactive members (why aren't they engaged?)</li>
            <li>People who attended once (what happened?)</li>
            <li>Former members (why did they leave?)</li>
            <li>People who almost joined but didn't (what stopped them?)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. EXPLORATION (10 min)</h3>

    <p><strong>Open-ended questions:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Tell me about the last time you used the website..."</li>
        <li>"Walk me through what you were trying to do..."</li>
        <li>"What was that experience like?"</li>
        <li>"How did that make you feel?"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Magic follow-ups (use constantly!):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Why?"</li>
        <li>"Tell me more about that..."</li>
        <li>"What do you mean by...?"</li>
        <li>"Can you give me an example?"</li>
        <li>"What were you hoping would happen?"</li>
        <li>"What actually happened?"</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Keep digging deeper!</strong></p>

    <h3>4. SPECIFIC PAGES (2 min)</h3>
    <p>Pick 2-3 pages they mentioned or ask about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Homepage</li>
        <li>Events calendar</li>
        <li>Membership info</li>
        <li>Activity groups</li>
        <li>Whatever they struggled with</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. CLOSING (1 min)</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "Is there anything else about the website that frustrates you or that you wish worked better?"
        <br><br>
        "Thank you! This is really helpful."
        <br><br>
        <strong>→ STOP RECORDING</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>WHAT TO DO WHEN...</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p><strong>They give one-word answers:</strong></p>
        <p>→ Ask "Can you tell me more about that?"<br>
        → Ask "Can you give me an example?"</p>

        <p><strong>They go off topic:</strong></p>
        <p>→ Let them finish, then: "That's interesting. Going back to the website..."</p>

        <p><strong>They say "It's fine":</strong></p>
        <p>→ Ask "What made you choose that word 'fine'?"<br>
        → Ask "If you could change one thing, what would it be?"</p>

        <p><strong>Long awkward pause:</strong></p>
        <p>→ That's okay! Let them think<br>
        → Count to 7 in your head before speaking</p>

        <p><strong>They ask what YOU think:</strong></p>
        <p>→ "I'm really curious about YOUR experience. What do you think?"</p>
    </div>
