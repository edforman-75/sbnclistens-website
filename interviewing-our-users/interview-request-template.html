Hi [Name],

I'm helping with a project to improve the SBNC website, and I'd love to get your input!

We're doing a focused effort to fix the most important pages - things like the landing page, calendar, event signup, and JOT forms. Before we make any changes, we want to hear from real members about their experiences.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick conversation? It can be over the phone, Zoom, or in person - whatever works best for you.

Your honest feedback would be incredibly valuable. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to understand how the website works (or doesn't work!) for you.

What I'm asking:
• 15 minutes of your time
• Permission to record our conversation (just for note-taking)
• Your honest thoughts about using the SBNC website

What it's NOT:
• A sales pitch
• A survey
• Anything you need to prepare for

Available this week or next? Let me know what works for your schedule!

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]

P.S. We're talking to lots of different members to get diverse perspectives, so your unique experience really matters!</div>
