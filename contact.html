                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Q: What if I can't find anyone to interview?</h3>
                    <p><strong>A:</strong> No problem! Pre-work is completely optional. Just come to the workshop on Nov 18th. If you'd like help finding interviewees, email us - we might be able to connect you with members who'd be happy to share their experiences.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Q: My recording didn't work. Should I try to remember what they said?</h3>
                    <p><strong>A:</strong> Don't try to reconstruct from memory - that's not reliable. Instead, apologize to your interviewee, explain the technical issue, and ask if you can redo the interview at their convenience. Most people are happy to help! Email us if you need troubleshooting help.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Q: Can I interview someone who's never used the website?</h3>
                    <p><strong>A:</strong> That's actually super valuable! Understanding why someone hasn't engaged with the website tells us a lot. Go for it!</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Q: What if the interview is going really well but we're past 15 minutes?</h3>
                    <p><strong>A:</strong> Let it continue! The 15-minute guideline is to help you (and your interviewee) plan time, but if they're sharing valuable insights, keep going. Just be respectful of their time and check if they need to wrap up.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Q: I submitted my interview but forgot to mention something important. What do I do?</h3>
                    <p><strong>A:</strong> Email us at technology@sbnewcomers.org with the additional context. Include the interviewee's name and date so we can match it to your submission.</p>
