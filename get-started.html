            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> This is completely optional but incredibly valuable. Even doing just one interview helps!</p>

            <ol class="steps">
                <li>
                    <strong>Read the Guides (30 minutes)</strong>
                    <p>Download and read the interview guide and cheat sheet. They teach you everything you need to know about conducting great conversations.</p>

                    <strong>Check Who's Already Being Interviewed (IMPORTANT!)</strong>
                    <p>Before finding people to interview, check our tracking list to see who's already been claimed by other interviewers. This prevents us from contacting the same people multiple times.</p>
                    <div class="info-box warning">
                        <h3>⚠️ Critical: Check First, Then Register</h3>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check the tracking spreadsheet to see if someone is already listed</p>
                        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJaoHTKC3GE2YDyUaihDQc5By6OfpLnHk4pLScbllSU/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1738229324#gid=1738229324" class="btn btn-secondary" target="_blank">📊 View Tracking List</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you've identified people who AREN'T on the list, register them so others know you're interviewing them</p>

                        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> We want to spread our interviews across as many different members as possible to get diverse perspectives!</p>

                    <strong>Find 2-3 People to Interview</strong>
                    <p>Think about members who've used the SBNC website. Variety is key! Look for recent joiners, inactive members, or former members - not just your super-engaged friends.</p>

                            <li>Inactive current members (why aren't they engaged?)</li>
                            <li>People who attended once and didn't return</li>
                            <li>Former members who let membership lapse</li>

                        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Highly engaged members figured out workarounds. People who struggled tell us what needs fixing!</p>

            <h3>⚠️ Critical: Seek Diverse Perspectives</h3>
            <p><strong>Don't just interview super-engaged members!</strong> The most valuable insights come from people who joined but aren't very active, people who attended once and didn't return, or former members who let membership lapse. Highly engaged members figured out workarounds - they won't tell us what's broken!</p>
