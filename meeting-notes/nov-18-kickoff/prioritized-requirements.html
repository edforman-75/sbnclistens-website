            <p>This page synthesizes the workshop chart pages into comprehensive requirements organized by priority level. These priorities emerged from collaborative discussions during the November 18 workshop, building on user research and member feedback.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>1. SBNC Brand & Identity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> The club should feel warm, welcoming, and social – "this looks like my people," not like a generic business site.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Use real photos of members and events (not stock) to convey energy, diversity of activities, and fun.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Reflect Santa Barbara's sense of place (ocean, mountains, lifestyle) without making the site feel like a tourist brochure.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Make the tone friendly and human in headings and copy, avoiding overly formal or bureaucratic language.</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Consider a short "Our Story" or "Traditions" section for those who want to learn more about the club's history.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Clearly explain the membership journey (Newbie → Newcomer → Extended, etc.) in one simple, visual flow.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Provide a "Start Here" / "New Member Guide" that tells people what to do in their first 90 days (what to sign up for, where to check info).</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Give new members confidence about "how things work" (guest rules, RSVP expectations, cancellations, no-shows).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Offer guidance on how many events per month is "normal" or recommended to get the most out of membership.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Include examples of common new-member questions and answers in an FAQ.</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Provide optional deeper background on governance, committees, and traditions for members who are curious later in their journey.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Make it easy to see that there are options for different comfort levels (small groups vs. large parties; more/less alcohol-centric).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Help members understand which events are especially good for meeting people (e.g., mixers, small dinners, walking groups).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Highlight "signature" or recurring events (Newbie mixers, big seasonal parties) so members can look forward to them.</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Show how events map to different member segments (20–40s, families, retirees, etc.) without overcomplicating the UI.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>

                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Clearly mark events as "Open," "Full / Waitlist," or "Closed," so expectations are set before clicking through.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Each event page must clearly answer: what it is, who it's for, when, where, cost, guest rules, and how to sign up.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> The registration call-to-action (button/link) should be impossible to miss and work smoothly on mobile.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Show the member's status on the event page: registered, waitlisted, or not yet registered.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Include practical logistics (parking, dress, what to bring, accessibility notes).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Show representative photos from past similar events when available, to help members visualize the experience.</li>

                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Provide a "My Events" page where members can see all upcoming events they're registered for in one place.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Show key details in that view (date, time, title, location, and status: confirmed vs. waitlist).</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Make it straightforward to cancel or change registrations within club policies, with clear consequences (e.g., refund rules, no-show expectations).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Show recent past events a member has attended as an activity history.</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Allow members to "favorite" or bookmark events they're interested in but not yet registered for.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Guest Policies & Rules Clarity</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Provide a simple, non-legalistic explanation of guest policies that members can understand quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Show guest eligibility and limits on the event page and during registration (e.g., "members only," "members + 1 guest," etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Clarify how many times the same guest may attend, and under what circumstances guests are encouraged to join as members.</li>

                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Make it easy to see where volunteers are needed and how to raise a hand (e.g., simple "I'm interested" form).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Show current committee chairs and key roles with contact info or a "contact the chair" button, respecting privacy and spam concerns.</li>

            <h2>9. Communications & Email Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Confirmation and reminder emails must clearly restate event name, date, time, location (with map link), and registration status.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Members should be able to get back from emails to the relevant event page or "My Events" with a single click.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Send a regular "Upcoming Events" digest that highlights a curated mix rather than everything in one long list.</li>

                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Allow members to choose what information appears in the directory (e.g., email, phone, neighborhood, photo).</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Consider adding optional "interest" or "activity" tags so people can find others with similar hobbies.</li>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>11. Website & Technology Infrastructure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> The site must be reliable and fast, especially for core flows (homepage → events → registration → confirmation).</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> Navigation should be simple and predictable: e.g., Home, Events, My Account / My Events, Committees & Volunteering, Resources.</li>
                <li><strong>[High]</strong> All essential flows must work well on mobile, given how often members use phones to check events and email.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Keep administrative workflows (creating events, managing rosters, updating content) as simple as possible for volunteer admins.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Ensure that integrations (payments, email, sign-on) are stable and tested so failures are rare and understandable when they occur.</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Add small UX enhancements (icons, subtle animations, hover states) only after stability and clarity are solid.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>12. Resources, FAQs & Onboarding Content</h2>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Maintain a concise FAQ with answers to the most common questions the board and event chairs receive.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Provide an internal "How to Host an Event" guide for event chairs and volunteers, linked from a board/admin area.</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Offer an archive of board-level documents (meeting notes, strategy docs) in a clearly labeled, access-controlled section.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>13. Advanced / Future Ideas (Lower Priority)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Experiment with short video introductions or recaps (e.g., board welcome, event highlights) if bandwidth and skills allow.</li>
                <li><strong>[Medium]</strong> Explore lightweight member feedback tools (short post-event surveys, quick polls about new event ideas).</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Add more sophisticated personalization (suggested events based on past attendance or stated interests).</li>
                <li><strong>[Low]</strong> Consider limited integrations with social media or photo galleries that automate sharing highlights, subject to privacy and consent.</li>
            </ul>
