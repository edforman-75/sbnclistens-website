- [00:00–00:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I must see a blank page because it is available, right?

- [00:04–00:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So I think that goes to our social media.

- [00:07–00:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I like the images on this page.

- [00:09–00:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  People having fun out of dance.

- [00:11–00:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes.

- [00:12–00:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes.

- [00:13–00:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What?

- [00:14–00:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We're just talking about...

- [00:15–00:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Having fun at events, yeah.

- [00:19–00:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Have images scrolling as you read through front of those texts.

- [00:25–00:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And there's probably too much text there.

- [00:27–00:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, I don't know.

- [00:28–00:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's a lot of text.

- [00:29–00:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm not sure who wants to read all of that.

- [00:31–00:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We could say all of that in about four lines and it would be, you know, a bunch
  of punchy.

- [00:36–00:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So ages, I think ages 30 to 75.

- [00:42–00:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We do have 20 something year old, but it's just very small.

- [00:45–00:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  20?

- [00:46–00:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [00:47–00:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  20 to 30 is there.

- [00:48–00:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [00:49–00:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Represent it.

- [00:50–01:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I actually think that this page should speak to the community in general and
  people who

- [01:00–01:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  might want to join the club.

- [01:02–01:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  In other words, this is our...

- [01:04–01:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  This really is our marketing page.

- [01:06–01:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That is absolutely.

- [01:07–01:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  This is not our operations page.

- [01:10–01:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's not anything...

- [01:11–01:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's our marketing page.

- [01:13–01:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [01:14–01:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it should be our sales pitch.

- [01:17–01:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Why we matter in the community.

- [01:19–01:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You know, who we are, it should be, you know...

- [01:27–01:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So can we do that visually as opposed to just...

- [01:31–01:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  100%.

- [01:32–01:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  100%.

- [01:33–01:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes.

- [01:34–01:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can do it.

- [01:35–01:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Let's do the committees.

- [01:36–01:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Multiple pictures.

- [01:37–01:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Committees slideshow, like a picture and a blurb.

- [01:40–01:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [01:41–01:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  A picture and a blurb.

- [01:42–01:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  A picture and a slide.

- [01:43–01:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And then a slide show and blurb and then show like community service, events,
  you know...

- [01:51–01:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [01:52–01:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Restaurants.

- [01:53–01:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  This page is for the 25% of the traffic that comes in from search.

- [01:58–01:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And prospects.

- [01:59–02:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [02:00–02:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Activities.

- [02:01–02:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [02:02–02:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Golf.

- [02:03–02:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Just different kinds.

- [02:04–02:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [02:05–02:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Just...

- [02:06–02:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And show multiple ages at different times.

- [02:09–02:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [02:10–02:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Beautifully, graphically.

- [02:11–02:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [02:12–02:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But each committee can be highlighted with a picture of how super fun.

- [02:15–02:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like just a simple picture.

- [02:16–02:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [02:17–02:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I would say that.

- [02:18–02:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Even books.

- [02:19–02:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I keep telling them like just look over your book.

- [02:20–02:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like all sedentary books.

- [02:21–02:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like that would be funny.

- [02:22–02:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [02:23–02:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But yet convey books.

- [02:24–02:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [02:25–02:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [02:26–02:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  If we can boil our activities into some big category buckets.

- [02:30–02:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You know, like you guys were saying just now, I think volunteering and the
  community

- [02:35–02:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is having like learning about the town, you know.

- [02:40–02:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [02:41–02:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Meeting new friends.

- [02:43–02:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Doing fun, you know, fun activities.

- [02:48–02:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's like those kind of big buckets of our activities that we, you know...

- [02:54–02:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [02:55–02:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I would...

- [02:56–02:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  A future or not an individual.

- [02:57–02:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [02:58–03:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I would break out of thinking of things on the homepage by committee and
  stuff like

- [03:03–03:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that.

- [03:04–03:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:05–03:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But he has volunteering and learning about that.

- [03:07–03:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I mean, it's...

- [03:08–03:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think he's speaking to the greater audience.

- [03:10–03:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Learning about...

- [03:11–03:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right.

- [03:12–03:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Volunteering, learning about town.

- [03:13–03:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:14–03:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Town.

- [03:15–03:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right.

- [03:16–03:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think it needs to be a simple message and not everything.

- [03:21–03:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right.

- [03:22–03:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:23–03:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Everything.

- [03:24–03:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's why there's too much text on here at this point.

- [03:25–03:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:26–03:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I want to be excited when I see this page and then want to find out more.

- [03:30–03:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:31–03:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:32–03:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  These are visuals with captions that give a flavor of what we offer, right?

- [03:36–03:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:37–03:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Her range still would appeal to a broad range.

- [03:39–03:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:40–03:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:41–03:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I can't see what's on this page right now.

- [03:42–03:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:43–03:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But even if we had big ideas, but they weren't there all together at one time,
  but they came

- [03:48–03:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  with a picture and you only saw one of them at a time, you know, so you don't
  have to...

- [03:53–03:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You're not reading their thing here.

- [03:57–03:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:58–03:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [03:59–04:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  This page has got to convey the important stuff.

- [04:01–04:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [04:02–04:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So it's on our Navy members, 60 to 70 events a month.

- [04:07–04:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like it's bullets.

- [04:08–04:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's like...

- [04:09–04:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [04:10–04:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's die across.

- [04:11–04:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [04:12–04:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  This is like why you should join.

- [04:13–04:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Without putting why you should join on a page.

- [04:15–04:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [04:16–04:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I just don't think putting a question on the top of a website is a good lead-
  in.

- [04:20–04:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But like, this is the value of it.

- [04:23–04:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Got a section that says why join us.

- [04:25–04:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [04:26–04:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's one of the dropdowns.

- [04:27–04:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right.

- [04:28–04:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Well, I get like get to it at some point, but I said we don't need to be saying
  why.

- [04:34–04:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's just the value problem, man.

- [04:36–04:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We've been around with kick-ass.

- [04:37–04:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We've got 680 people.

- [04:38–04:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We've got fun.

- [04:39–04:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And we're doing what they can think we are.

- [04:42–04:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Show me some cool ass pictures.

- [04:44–04:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And then if I want to lean in, oh, there's something for everyone.

- [04:47–04:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Oh, you got 30 clubs.

- [04:48–04:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Oh, that's cool.

- [04:49–04:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I like to knit.

- [04:50–04:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Oh, there's knitting.

- [04:51–04:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Awesome.

- [04:52–04:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [04:53–05:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I would like to see this page lead directly towards becoming a member and
  towards public

- [05:02–05:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  events, to the extent that we have events that really are general public to
  which we

- [05:08–05:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  would want people who are not public members.

- [05:11–05:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You know, I think we really should think about this as our outside, our biggest
  opportunity

- [05:19–05:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  outside the logging, outside authentication to communicate and to get people to
  want to

- [05:28–05:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  be on the other side of the authentication wall.

- [05:31–05:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [05:32–05:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like a separate calendar and adjustments or things like that.

- [05:35–05:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Or lead to that.

- [05:36–05:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [05:37–05:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What about a call to action?

- [05:39–05:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like specifically like you say.

- [05:40–05:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

- [05:41–05:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Call to action specifically.

- [05:42–05:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Take a look at, like sign up for attend a public event, join to be a member now
  or learn more.

- [05:48–05:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [05:49–05:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [05:50–05:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [05:51–05:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Or we have these orientations that we love, which have a cleaning parties.

- [05:55–05:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You don't have to be a member.

- [05:57–06:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like Eric and I opened that up to non-members and we were the VPs of membership.

- [06:01–06:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The call to action.

- [06:02–06:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And we used it to like close people.

- [06:04–06:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [06:05–06:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I can't tell you, loads of people will come to that check out the club.

- [06:07–06:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We were closing.

- [06:08–06:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Nice.

- [06:09–06:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You've seen enough.

- [06:11–06:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Closing as in making this deal to each other.

- [06:14–06:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And you want to join?

- [06:15–06:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No, I'm joining up.

- [06:16–06:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I want to join.

- [06:17–06:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No, I got it.

- [06:18–06:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm going to join up.

- [06:19–06:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay, cool.

- [06:20–06:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm going to check and make sure you do.

- [06:21–06:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Call to action.

- [06:22–06:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Those are like sales stuff.

- [06:23–06:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right.

- [06:24–06:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [06:25–06:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So call to action with clear next steps.

- [06:27–06:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [06:28–06:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And by the way, you don't have to think of everything being on this page that
  might be motivational.

- [06:39–06:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I mean, we can put more stuff outside authentication.

- [06:43–06:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think we should where it's like I've said, we could put things under
  frequently asked

- [06:47–06:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  questions and people are kind of like, well, what about this?

- [06:49–06:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What about this?

- [06:50–06:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It shouldn't be overwhelming on the front page.

- [06:52–06:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I agree.

- [06:53–06:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [06:54–06:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Learn more in front of the paper.

- [06:55–06:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Learn behind the paper.

- [06:56–07:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Because once you're in the club, you don't need the about us section.

- [07:00–07:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  If you're looking for the about us section after you're in the club.

- [07:04–07:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So Steve, just to pick up on that, I wouldn't like to be a more bogus.

- [07:10–07:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It has a little bit of the history of the club and shows, you know, that piece
  of collateral

- [07:16–07:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  from 50 years ago and all that stuff.

- [07:19–07:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I mean, I think there's something about participating in a Santa Barbara
  tradition.

- [07:24–07:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But it's different.

- [07:25–07:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's the resources tab.

  Once you're logged in is very different information than you're not trying to
  read the history

- [07:31–07:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  of the club on the front page and the slash page.

- [07:34–07:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think so.

- [07:35–07:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Well, maybe have access to it.

- [07:39–07:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [07:40–07:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [07:41–07:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think a timeline.

- [07:42–07:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's something that's already in the FAQs that are to those points.

- [07:45–07:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like why, like they tell more about what it's like to be a member or why.

- [07:49–07:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It has to be easy to find.

- [07:51–07:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's right there.

- [07:52–07:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But I don't dare anyone to tell us the metrics on how many people are.

- [07:57–07:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [07:58–07:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What do you guys do?

- [07:59–08:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I just want to add one thing about FAQs, which is as the world moves forward
  and we

- [08:04–08:13]  
  **INSIGHT** · _Confidence: High_  
  move from search engines to chat box, FAQs are the very most important resource
  because

- [08:13–08:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  things are going to give you the answer rather than giving you a list of
  results.

- [08:18–08:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it's FAQs that are extremely potent.

- [08:21–08:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So it hasn't come up, but we really should have a public and a member, a public
  FAQ

- [08:28–08:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  section because that's, that's the new search.

- [08:31–08:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [08:32–08:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The FAQ section here has got five, five lines in it basically.

- [08:38–08:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You can have 500 answers in the FAQ.

- [08:41–08:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I know.

- [08:42–08:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It doesn't matter.

- [08:43–08:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's minimal.

- [08:44–08:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's a waste.

- [08:45–08:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't know.

- [08:46–08:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Anybody else ever looked at the FAQs?

- [08:47–08:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I spent a lot of time on the public website over the last couple of months
  because it's

- [08:53–08:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  where people come in and we had to do a lot of work on that, John.

- [08:56–08:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we had problems.

- [08:58–09:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we're dealing with it.

- [09:00–09:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  This is important.

- [09:01–09:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But here's what I would say.

- [09:02–09:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like to me, this is the lowest hanging tree that might have the highest impact
  on prospective

- [09:09–09:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  members.

- [09:10–09:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I think balancing the work is like, okay, focus on people we haven't met yet
  that are

- [09:14–09:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  going to do the future of the club, but then let's also focus our energy on
  people that

- [09:18–09:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  are in the club.

- [09:19–09:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But this to me is, like if you read through this, we have five different numbers
  on how

- [09:24–09:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  many people were in the club.

- [09:26–09:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We have four different numbers on how many events we have each month.

- [09:29–09:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like one says we have over a hundred every month.

- [09:32–09:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't know what club that is.

- [09:34–09:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Some says we have a minimum maybe every month.

- [09:37–09:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like there's a lot of kids, but this is low.

- [09:39–09:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's ugly.

- [09:40–09:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's ugly as hell.

- [09:42–09:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's no pictures of cool people like this.

- [09:45–09:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think for me, I don't like these words like non-negotiables.

- [09:47–09:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But if somebody wants to work with me on this, like I will write this content
  with you like

- [09:52–09:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  this, this we can fix.

- [09:54–09:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [09:55–09:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [09:56–09:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Because a lot of the information is we know that we just need to put it in.

- [09:59–10:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We are so much cooler than this.

- [10:00–10:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We are so much more fun than this.

- [10:02–10:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The photo, the photo is gorgeous, but one, it doesn't have people.

- [10:05–10:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No people.

- [10:06–10:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Literally a people club.

- [10:07–10:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And then two, it looks like a post-apocalyptic scene.

- [10:10–10:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It looks like Santa Barbara during the fires.

- [10:16–10:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [10:17–10:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No one has a soul inside it.

- [10:19–10:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Low legs.

- [10:20–10:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Low legs.

- [10:21–10:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Low legs.

- [10:22–10:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So, better photography at least realize.

- [10:26–10:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We have so many wonderful photos.

- [10:28–10:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So many shots that all the categories that Leslie was saying that could be.

- [10:32–10:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right.

- [10:33–10:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I think.

- [10:34–10:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I have one quick question.

- [10:35–10:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Sorry.

- [10:36–10:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So the wide newcomers and the about us feel like they just need to be
  consolidated one

- [10:40–10:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  page.

- [10:41–10:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Was that something that you guys that came up?

- [10:43–10:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think it was not a tops-top page.

- [10:45–10:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No.

- [10:46–10:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But we didn't really give away for people to comment that way.

- [10:50–10:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We directed it.

- [10:51–10:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Look at the pages.

- [10:53–11:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  If humans had been doing the analysis, they would have maybe linked things more
  thematically.

- [11:02–11:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm just suggesting that maybe.

- [11:03–11:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No, I agree with you.

- [11:04–11:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I agree.

- [11:05–11:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I agree.

- [11:06–11:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You're right.

- [11:07–11:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like.

- [11:08–11:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  About us.

- [11:09–11:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [11:10–11:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I was saying is a defect in the way we approach things was we went page by page
  using the

- [11:17–11:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  current architecture.

- [11:19–11:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [11:20–11:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I don't think it's the right architecture anyway.

- [11:23–11:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But we'll get to that because that's our fourth thing to talk about.

- [11:27–11:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, that was one.

- [11:28–11:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's our fifth thing to talk about.

- [11:29–11:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Gotcha.

- [11:30–11:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Jim, let's move on.

- [11:31–11:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [11:32–11:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So we can vote.

- [11:33–11:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Do we have a home visit?

- [11:34–11:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They're kind of some of these.

- [11:35–11:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's a little bit redundant here.

- [11:36–11:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I just said, I just did the made-up comments.

- [11:39–11:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And you captured the.

- [11:40–11:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We're going to call it about us.

- [11:42–11:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right.

- [11:43–11:44]

- [11:50–11:51]

  This is still happening.

- [11:51–11:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  This is.

- [11:52–11:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You know.

- [11:53–11:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Does it have a home page or just.

- [11:57–11:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's going to say that we know.

- [11:59–12:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [12:00–12:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You never call it home.

- [12:02–12:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [12:03–12:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right.

- [12:04–12:05]

- [12:05–12:06]

  Yes.

- [16:40–16:44]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  But if you learn about intent, it's relevant.

- [16:44–16:49]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  Social marketing is now driving your intent.

- [16:49–16:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So, that's why that's a search.

- [16:51–16:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

- [16:54–16:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That was about navigation.

- [16:57–16:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [16:58–17:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So, I feel like I have to go back a lot more steps.

- [17:02–17:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That went in the app, two items, and then in the seven, I talked to your items a
  lot,

- [17:07–17:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  put through other buttons, took a while before I set up a page, throwing
  documents at the

- [17:14–17:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  bottom, throwing documents at the same, this page.

- [17:17–17:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay, did you have a cake?

- [17:18–17:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I put this one, link email to event and get reminder when it's open, which was
  on our

- [17:23–17:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  other page.

- [17:24–17:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's kind of a navigation thing.

- [17:26–17:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So, navigation, what would we want?

- [17:29–17:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think probably we should all try looking at these pages.

- [17:38–17:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I know.

- [17:39–17:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We're finding stuff.

- [17:40–17:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We didn't realize it right.

- [17:41–17:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think that's a kind of a problem is a lot of us.

- [17:44–17:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's too much.

- [17:45–17:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I was just not looking at about and why newcomers, and there's so much
  repetitive

- [17:52–17:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  stuff that links back to each other and repeats itself and what in the heck.

- [17:58–18:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So, just something like a clear-eyed look at that logical navigation.

- [18:05–18:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, and consolidate.

- [18:06–18:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's a small number of pages.

- [18:09–18:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [18:10–18:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  If we can get them to like five to seven menu items, like that's manageable.

- [18:17–18:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, there's a lot of websites have a thing that's actually called menu.

- [18:22–18:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And it's like the hamburger over there.

- [18:25–18:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And you hit it, but you get more than three.

- [18:28–18:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You get eight.

- [18:29–18:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And you think five to seven choices?

- [18:31–18:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Five to seven top level menu items.

- [18:33–18:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Top level, okay.

- [18:34–18:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [18:35–18:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Isn't the hamburger functioning now?

- [18:38–18:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  These are all the things that just didn't fit on our menu bar, but they're still
  equally

- [18:42–18:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  there.

- [18:43–18:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They're meant to be equally.

- [18:45–18:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yes.

- [18:46–18:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's currently overflow.

- [18:47–18:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's overflow.

- [18:48–18:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's not like a little separate little extra bonus section.

- [18:53–18:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's overflow.

- [18:54–18:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The hamburger.

- [18:55–18:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [18:56–18:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it's hiding contact.

- [18:57–18:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's hiding important things.

- [18:59–19:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we need to either have fewer things and they all fit or prioritize.

- [19:06–19:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Does anyone know the history of the volunteer section?

- [19:12–19:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Because it seems completely unrelated to our club.

- [19:15–19:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's not a volunteer.

- [19:17–19:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's no one associated with the club who has any idea about anything.

- [19:22–19:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We do.

- [19:23–19:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I do.

- [19:24–19:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You do?

- [19:25–19:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I do.

- [19:26–19:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And there's nothing there, I think.

- [19:28–19:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes, there is.

- [19:29–19:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's tons of stuff.

- [19:30–19:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And it's all not related to the club.

- [19:32–19:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Leslie, what?

- [19:33–19:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Tell us, Leslie.

- [19:34–19:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I know.

- [19:35–19:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I was telling you.

- [19:36–19:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So the volunteer and action committee, so in parallel with the chair.

- [19:39–19:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, you're right.

- [19:40–19:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm sorry.

- [19:41–19:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's one at the end.

- [19:42–19:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  If you click on one.

- [19:43–19:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, wait.

- [19:44–19:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Somebody hit the floor.

- [19:45–19:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can talk and stick.

- [19:46–19:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can't hit it.

- [19:47–19:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They created a database of all of the volunteer organizations in town that have
  been vetted

- [19:52–19:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  by the volunteers and action committee.

- [19:54–19:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So that it's a, if you wanted to volunteer, but it wasn't through like as an
  individual

- [19:59–20:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and you wanted to be involved in the community that way.

- [20:02–20:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Here's a resource and look for volunteer organizations in the community.

- [20:09–20:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And they, it's filterable.

- [20:11–20:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So it's maintained by the volunteers and action committee.

- [20:15–20:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And that's what it's for.

- [20:16–20:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [20:17–20:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But should it be top priority in our?

- [20:19–20:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No, necessarily, but it's hidden.

- [20:21–20:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And also there isn't an explanation.

- [20:24–20:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right.

- [20:25–20:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So actually for our top level navigation, I would like to make a proposal that
  something

- [20:31–20:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that will mature over time.

- [20:33–20:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think it's a public resource.

- [20:36–20:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We as a newcomers club should create something called the newcomers guide to
  Santa Barbara.

- [20:42–20:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it should be things like, where do you register to vote?

- [20:46–20:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Where's the DMV or how do you register a car in California?

- [20:49–20:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  These are all links to other things.

- [20:52–20:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It can be the volunteer organizations in town.

- [20:55–20:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It can be the major cultural institutions, things like that.

- [20:59–21:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And, you know, our committees, if we wanted to, we could make them responsive or
  maintaining

- [21:05–21:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  their, their section of it.

- [21:07–21:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But I think it would be a really good public resource for the newcomers
  committee to offer.

- [21:14–21:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [21:15–21:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it is a maintainable kind of thing.

- [21:17–21:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You're having Claude write it right now, aren't you?

- [21:20–21:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Claude could do it in a couple of hours.

- [21:23–21:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I feel like he's almost done.

- [21:25–21:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So what would we, what would we want to have as our main navigation, you know,
  in terms

- [21:30–21:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  of the, if we have the six to seven or five to seven things?

- [21:34–21:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  In front of the paywalls.

- [21:36–21:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yes.

- [21:37–21:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm just trying to, I just want to, I hate to be a public or a stickler on it,
  but like.

- [21:41–21:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Because these are right now what we're seeing is behind the pay, behind the
  login.

- [21:44–21:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [21:45–21:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm thinking behind the login.

- [21:46–21:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So there's no hamburger menu if you're not logged in.

- [21:49–21:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's less.

- [21:50–21:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [21:51–21:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm going to do something.

- [21:52–21:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm going to show you what it looks like.

- [21:53–21:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Go live.

- [21:54–21:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But keep talking because it's going to take me a moment.

- [21:57–22:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Because we think that it's, we really want behind the paywall.

- [22:00–22:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we're talking about members so they can find stuff.

- [22:03–22:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Do we want inside?

- [22:04–22:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Both.

- [22:05–22:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Which do you want to see first?

- [22:06–22:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Inside or outside?

- [22:07–22:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Outside first.

- [22:08–22:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [22:09–22:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Keep talking.

- [22:10–22:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [22:11–22:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  If you want to do inside then.

- [22:13–22:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So answer the question.

- [22:14–22:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's no hamburger.

- [22:15–22:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  To answer a question that you all might have heard earlier.

- [22:19–22:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The website launched in 2003.

- [22:21–22:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Wow.

- [22:22–22:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It was last updated in 2014.

- [22:25–22:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Wow.

- [22:26–22:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So in 2014, like nav, like design, nav design, you wanted as many pages as
  possible, right?

- [22:33–22:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  For search indexing and things like that.

- [22:35–22:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So it makes sense that they've got a lot of pages that are redundant and stuff
  like that

- [22:40–22:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because that's what drove search relevancy over indexing.

- [22:45–22:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's interesting.

- [22:46–22:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I don't know.

- [22:47–22:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I know a lot.

- [22:48–22:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't know how often users see this.

- [22:56–22:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I see it from time to time.

- [22:58–23:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But I do have some things from this IP address.

- [23:02–23:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That pound while they're apricot.

- [23:06–23:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But I cannot at this moment show you our web page because this is our URL at
  this moment.

- [23:13–23:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  For you.

- [23:14–23:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  For me.

- [23:15–23:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  For you.

- [23:16–23:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  For my IP address.

- [23:17–23:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Oh.

- [23:18–23:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It didn't copy me or did the same thing.

- [23:20–23:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I have a way of doing it.

- [23:21–23:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'll do it to my phone.

- [23:22–23:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Just give me a moment.

- [23:23–23:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [23:24–23:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I can cast to that.

- [23:25–23:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm on the website.

- [23:26–23:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Can he cast?

- [23:27–23:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [23:28–23:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I could probably cast to your TV.

- [23:29–23:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There are a lot.

- [23:30–23:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, you don't.

- [23:31–23:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Do you have a map?

- [23:32–23:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I got an iPad.

- [23:33–23:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, yeah.

- [23:34–23:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [23:35–23:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I'm not on your Wi-Fi.

- [23:36–23:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm on my Wi-Fi.

- [23:37–23:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [23:38–23:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Give me a moment.

- [23:39–23:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I will have the page up.

- [23:40–23:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can put them on the way.

- [23:41–23:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Give me a moment.

- [23:42–23:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I can do it.

- [23:43–23:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [23:44–23:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So let's have this title ideally.

- [23:45–23:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'll set the name while outside.

- [23:46–23:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [23:47–23:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think the public event calendar.

- [23:48–23:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [23:49–23:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The why you should join us home page.

- [23:50–23:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Two different things.

- [23:51–23:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  In front of the paywall.

- [23:52–23:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [23:53–23:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [23:54–23:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [23:55–23:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [23:56–23:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [23:57–23:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [23:58–23:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  These are things that, hey, here's who we are.

- [23:59–24:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Here's the things you can do.

- [24:00–24:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:01–24:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Public events, gallery of pictures.

- [24:02–24:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Gallery of stuff you can do.

- [24:03–24:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:04–24:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  F-A-Q's around how to join, what the member experience is.

- [24:05–24:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:06–24:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What it costs.

- [24:07–24:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Do we think we said to leave the committee names out of it?

- [24:12–24:22]  
  **INSIGHT** · _Confidence: Medium_  
  I would actually like to showcase the committees in a way that I think is the
  most important

- [24:22–24:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  thing.

- [24:23–24:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:24–24:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  In front of the paywall.

- [24:25–24:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:26–24:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So people know there's something for everyone.

- [24:27–24:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:28–24:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like people have very nuanced hobbies.

- [24:29–24:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right.

- [24:30–24:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And like.

- [24:31–24:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What would it be then to just scroll down and see all these activities?

- [24:32–24:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What page?

- [24:33–24:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think it's, right now it lives in a separate tab.

- [24:34–24:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Committee.

- [24:35–24:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's two different tabs, actually.

- [24:36–24:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Why do you turn them into committees and both list committees?

- [24:37–24:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But how do you do that?

- [24:38–24:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think it's a separate tab.

- [24:39–24:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:40–24:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:41–24:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:42–24:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:43–24:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:44–24:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:45–24:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:46–24:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:47–24:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:48–24:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:49–24:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:50–24:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [24:51–24:52]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  There's multiple activities.

- [24:52–24:55]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  But having it, rather than just like a giant list, what if it's like a visual
  tab.

- [24:55–24:56]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  So.

- [24:56–24:57]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  shining something like that.

- [24:57–25:18]  
  **INSIGHT** · _Confidence: Low_  
  Click and you see better just go ahead and

- [25:18–25:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  down below with no pictures.

- [25:20–25:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Down below no pictures, but here, each committee is shown.

- [25:23–25:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can't see them all at once.

- [25:24–25:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's not it.

- [25:24–25:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right, okay, yeah.

- [25:25–25:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So that's just a different way

- [25:26–25:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  we can display this information,

- [25:27–25:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  so that's a good navigation.

- [25:29–25:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Displayed artistically.

- [25:31–25:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So just taking this Steve's idea for a second,

- [25:34–25:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  outside the payroll,

- [25:35–25:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't think committees is our internal organization.

- [25:41–25:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But those are interest groups.

- [25:42–25:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, yeah, let me finish, because that's why I was going.

- [25:46–25:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What I was going is that we should be talking

- [25:49–25:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  about the areas of focus.

- [25:53–25:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It should be more about topics and kinds of things.

- [25:58–26:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't, committees happens to be internally

- [26:01–26:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  how we're organized to implement events.

- [26:05–26:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But I don't think committees to the outside world

- [26:10–26:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is meaningful, and I don't think exhibiting it adds value.

- [26:15–26:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But it's activities.

- [26:16–26:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's types of events, though.

- [26:17–26:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes, yes.

- [26:18–26:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's what I'm saying.

- [26:19–26:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It turns out it is important.

- [26:21–26:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So when I thought about it, I thought about it as communities,

- [26:23–26:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but I also thought about it as interest groups.

- [26:25–26:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, yes.

- [26:26–26:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So I thought about, okay,

- [26:27–26:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  how do I make it not sound like work?

- [26:29–26:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [26:29–26:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And like hitches groups, like happy hikers.

- [26:33–26:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What if it's activities?

- [26:35–26:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Huh?

- [26:35–26:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What if it's just activities and events?

- [26:36–26:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Interest and activities.

- [26:38–26:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You want to appreciate it?

- [26:38–26:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [26:39–26:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, I think there's a way to

- [26:42–26:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  make it sound, yeah.

- [26:44–26:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right?

- [26:45–26:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like with external language, yeah.

- [26:46–26:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, okay.

- [26:47–26:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Which is interesting, because part of the way you make friends

- [26:49–26:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  really get the best out of the club,

- [26:50–26:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  as you say, your orientation is joining a committee,

- [26:53–26:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but you're right,

- [26:54–26:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  leading with that sounds like too much.

- [26:55–26:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's like too much to assume.

- [26:56–26:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, hey, it sounds like a cult.

- [26:58–26:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You're asking me to join a committee

- [26:59–27:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  before I even get here.

- [27:01–27:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You're a white part of the book.

- [27:02–27:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right.

- [27:04–27:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay, so basically for public view,

- [27:06–27:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  we have ideas of public events,

- [27:09–27:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  why I joined us, what we are,

- [27:11–27:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  our galleries, FIQ,

- [27:12–27:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and some kind of interest activity groups kind of thing.

- [27:17–27:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And then maybe a timeline,

- [27:19–27:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but just-

- [27:20–27:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  History?

- [27:20–27:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Just like a good one, right?

- [27:22–27:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [27:23–27:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  This is the oldest,

- [27:24–27:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and because we got a diverse group of folks

- [27:29–27:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  that are moving to this community of different ages,

- [27:32–27:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and we got to cast a free white net.

- [27:36–27:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Is there a number on the screen?

- [27:37–27:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [27:38–27:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  6332.

- [27:39–27:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  6332.

- [27:40–27:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We're casting.

- [27:45–27:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yep.

- [27:48–27:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Look, it's a jar in the bed.

- [27:49–27:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Sorry, I shouldn't have done that.

- [27:51–27:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can just say,

- [27:52–27:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  no, it's not really just there.

- [27:57–27:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I love the idea of shrinking this down

- [27:59–28:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  in front of the paywall,

- [28:00–28:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and be like, hey, here are the four-

- [28:02–28:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's right.

- [28:03–28:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I see that.

- [28:04–28:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You've got to know, right?

- [28:05–28:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [28:06–28:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's better for them though, a little higher.

- [28:08–28:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We got to kick ass events.

- [28:09–28:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [28:11–28:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We got great interest groups and activities.

- [28:13–28:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  My back looks a little silver.

- [28:14–28:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We got a gallery of fun stuff.

- [28:16–28:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Back in the morning?

- [28:16–28:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And you know.

- [28:17–28:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Back in the morning, more.

- [28:18–28:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [28:19–28:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You know, my view is,

- [28:23–28:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  typically as a marketer,

- [28:24–28:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you think about what shows up above the scroll.

- [28:28–28:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Fold, yeah.

- [28:29–28:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's surprising to me that we're all here,

- [28:32–28:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  that we have any members whatsoever,

- [28:36–28:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  given that this is our primary marketing piece.

- [28:40–28:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think his word of mouth is so small.

- [28:41–28:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Nobody joined because of this.

- [28:42–28:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's a good representation.

- [28:44–28:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's another idea actually,

- [28:45–28:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  is like testimonials, some sort of clips of things.

- [28:48–28:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And all my best friends here.

- [28:49–28:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's a great idea.

- [28:51–28:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [28:52–28:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We'll put that in the comments below.

- [28:55–28:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  First of all, testimonials.

- [28:56–29:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And one of us joined before we actually saw this.

- [29:00–29:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I agree with you, John, in that.

- [29:02–29:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I talked to a member today.

- [29:03–29:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm not going to say his person's name.

- [29:05–29:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You all know his person's job.

- [29:07–29:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm not going to tell you his name.

- [29:09–29:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I talked to them today.

- [29:10–29:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They were very active in the club.

- [29:11–29:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I was asking them about a leadership position.

- [29:16–29:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And they said to me in all honesty,

- [29:18–29:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Steve, I'm good.

- [29:19–29:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The club has done its job.

- [29:21–29:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I have made a lot of friends.

- [29:24–29:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I have done its job.

- [29:25–29:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't, I've committed and done what I needed to do

- [29:29–29:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  for two years.

- [29:30–29:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I feel like I've gotten and I've given

- [29:32–29:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and the club did its job.

- [29:34–29:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And now I want to spend time with those friends.

- [29:36–29:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I'm like, you know what?

- [29:37–29:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's a legitimate view.

- [29:39–29:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's a, I mean, like, and this person had given a lot.

- [29:42–29:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So it wasn't a selfish person who took and didn't give.

- [29:46–29:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I was like, what a great testimonial

- [29:48–29:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  if we could rephrase it a little bit.

- [29:50–29:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [29:50–29:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'll add it back.

- [29:51–29:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Hey, I don't want to, I don't want you on the other board

- [29:56–29:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  to do this job.

- [29:57–29:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So I think you should have a lot of clogged

- [29:59–30:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and help us write the testimonial.

- [30:01–30:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, yeah, we'll do that.

- [30:02–30:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So we can find a quote that gives the same vibe,

- [30:05–30:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but I don't like the idea that, you know.

- [30:07–30:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, I get it.

- [30:08–30:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But like testimonials are great.

- [30:09–30:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They're not a help for you, which really does the best.

- [30:12–30:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Five star reviews, man.

- [30:13–30:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, yeah.

- [30:14–30:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's a pretty self-serving view, though, isn't it?

- [30:16–30:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Which one?

- [30:17–30:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, I've got a lot of ideas.

- [30:19–30:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So, yeah, I don't need to get back.

- [30:20–30:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  As opposed to, that's what you heard to get back.

- [30:23–30:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, this person's given plenty.

- [30:25–30:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, he has.

- [30:26–30:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Meant much.

- [30:27–30:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Maybe too much.

- [30:29–30:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's been a while.

- [30:30–30:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay, so let's go to navigation for the members.

- [30:34–30:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Let's just, we want to focus on,

- [30:35–30:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  we've talked about what we're thinking about

- [30:37–30:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  for the outside the paywall, but I can see the members.

- [30:40–30:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Now we're behind the paywall.

- [30:42–30:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [30:43–30:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  One last question is, are we,

- [30:44–30:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  so we're just coming with what we want, not looking at it.

- [30:46–30:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What we want, what we want.

- [30:48–30:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  See what should stay or go.

- [30:50–30:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Uh-huh.

- [30:57–30:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So there's intersearch string.

- [30:58–30:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What happened?

- [30:59–31:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I never log out.

- [31:01–31:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Ever something.

- [31:01–31:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, this is Jan's machine.

- [31:05–31:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You're kind of logged out a year and a half.

- [31:07–31:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Never used that string.

- [31:09–31:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I've been logged out every six months.

- [31:10–31:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They're giving me a job.

- [31:11–31:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I used it for the day, I didn't find anyone.

- [31:14–31:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I just, there you go, I tried it just to see.

- [31:15–31:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So now we're in as a member.

- [31:17–31:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  As a member.

- [31:18–31:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  All right, we're logged in as Jan.

- [31:20–31:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, that's right.

- [31:21–31:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And not committee chair, Jan, but Jan.

- [31:24–31:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right, Jan, too long ago.

- [31:26–31:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So we're in as Jan.

- [31:27–31:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's right.

- [31:28–31:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  All right.

- [31:29–31:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So talking about like the top, the top menus here,

- [31:32–31:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  the navigation.

- [31:34–31:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So just the line page.

- [31:35–31:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  My page, yeah.

- [31:36–31:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The page where we call it, but it's all about me.

- [31:38–31:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, mm-hmm.

- [31:39–31:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And then calendar again, I think.

- [31:42–31:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Did you want to make that funny and maybe be like me?

- [31:45–31:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [31:47–31:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  How do you do it?

- [31:47–31:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Laugh.

- [31:49–31:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  All right.

- [31:50–31:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Sounds like directories is good.

- [31:51–31:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Directories?

- [31:52–31:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [31:52–31:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Or resources or whatever.

- [31:54–31:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think they're two separate things.

- [31:56–31:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Resources.

- [31:59–32:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Committees makes a lot of sense, I think.

- [32:03–32:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know if we have the resources to do it now,

- [32:05–32:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but I think gallery is a really nice thing to have.

- [32:09–32:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right now, gallery is just pulling from Instagram.

- [32:12–32:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [32:12–32:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But we can do more.

- [32:15–32:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, we could do.

- [32:17–32:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm not.

- [32:18–32:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know if it's in scope or out of scope.

- [32:20–32:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Everyone said it's critically important.

- [32:22–32:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's in scope to do right now.

- [32:24–32:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's probably easier to do it in Instagram

- [32:27–32:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and just fix that bug if there's a possibility.

- [32:29–32:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  To have something.

- [32:30–32:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  To have thumbnails rather than it pulling from the screen.

- [32:32–32:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm just going to interject really quickly.

- [32:34–32:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And again, out of scope, we're going to do it next time.

- [32:37–32:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I cannot tell you how many people have said to me,

- [32:40–32:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I wish there was a way to see all the pictures

- [32:42–32:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  that I've taken or what they've taken,

- [32:45–32:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  all the people, if there was a place to put them,

- [32:47–32:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  on our website, which they have to log in to get

- [32:50–32:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  so they're secure.

- [32:52–32:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I probably have about 4,000 to 5,000 photos

- [32:55–32:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  for the last five months.

- [32:56–32:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And people will never know.

- [32:58–32:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Sometimes they say, see someone,

- [32:59–32:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I have a great photo of you,

- [32:59–33:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  won't you find it's an IT for you?

- [33:01–33:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They don't know.

- [33:03–33:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So just for what it's worth, someone who kind of knows

- [33:06–33:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  what they're doing with AI could build a photo gallery

- [33:11–33:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  with upload, download, filtering, photos,

- [33:15–33:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  download my photo, all that stuff in the afternoon.

- [33:19–33:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So don't perceive this as being a hard thing to do.

- [33:22–33:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't think it's hard.

- [33:24–33:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't think it's hard.

- [33:26–33:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think about, Dana's right,

- [33:29–33:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because I'm with her when people ask,

- [33:30–33:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  like when the president's party at the casino night,

- [33:33–33:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  she took a bunch of pictures.

- [33:34–33:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So many people are like, can you see that picture of me?

- [33:37–33:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I'm like, oh my God, like,

- [33:39–33:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but then you have people who are really touching

- [33:42–33:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  about their pictures being up in a gallery.

- [33:46–33:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And even though it's behind a firewall.

- [33:49–33:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And also they sign the video, maybe.

- [33:51–33:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [33:52–33:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  My god, there's a picture of me.

- [33:54–33:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think it should.

- [33:55–33:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think people want their photos.

- [33:56–33:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, again, I'm not arguing with you

- [33:58–33:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  in front of everybody.

- [33:59–34:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I agree with you 100%.

- [34:01–34:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And you're right.

- [34:02–34:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, what can I do better?

- [34:03–34:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, I would like to talk that out a little bit

- [34:08–34:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  before we try to enable it, okay?

- [34:10–34:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Because people have different points of view

- [34:12–34:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  on their images.

- [34:14–34:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [34:15–34:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, could we have a way that we upload stuff

- [34:17–34:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and then if you want yours deleted,

- [34:18–34:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you could delete them or something.

- [34:20–34:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You could certainly do that.

- [34:21–34:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [34:22–34:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The other thing is why it's real fun to opt out.

- [34:25–34:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They can opt out.

- [34:25–34:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They can opt out.

- [34:26–34:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The other thing I will point out

- [34:28–34:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  is we have our media agreement.

- [34:30–34:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And we have a right to do whatever we want.

- [34:32–34:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We do.

- [34:33–34:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Click-rack.

- [34:34–34:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, I just don't think click-rack agreements

- [34:36–34:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  should give you the right to put stuff in someone's face.

- [34:38–34:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh my gosh.

- [34:39–34:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's working like a true American.

- [34:40–34:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  See, if I do that, it's a day.

- [34:41–34:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I know.

- [34:42–34:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, I think, again, you're right.

- [34:44–34:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  As you had the place about what you put on your list.

- [34:47–34:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  One time, when you were abducted by aliens,

- [34:50–34:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  none of y'all called me.

- [34:52–34:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  All the crazy stuff I've done on the list is super first.

- [34:55–34:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  All right.

- [34:55–34:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So the other thing I'd like to see in our member navigation

- [34:59–35:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and maybe even our outside navigation

- [35:01–35:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is just at the bottom of the page, like many people have,

- [35:05–35:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  we can have a bunch of links to very specific things

- [35:09–35:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that people might be looking for.

- [35:13–35:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's easy to do.

- [35:14–35:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They all exist.

- [35:16–35:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And that's a modern website.

- [35:18–35:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Tends to have.

- [35:19–35:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like what?

- [35:20–35:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like talking about my contact us and stuff like that,

- [35:23–35:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  or what do you think about that?

- [35:28–35:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's where often you'll see contact.

- [35:31–35:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You'll often see mailing address.

- [35:33–35:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You'll often see.

- [35:35–35:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Learn more button is what I'll be finding.

- [35:39–35:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, just the thing at the very.

- [35:43–35:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And it's basically the standard footer

- [35:46–35:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  on every page.

- [35:48–35:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Our footer now has the little Facebook logo, the Instagram

- [35:52–35:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  logo, and the old Twitter logo.

- [35:58–35:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The one that we most put.

- [35:59–36:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, yeah.

- [36:01–36:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [36:02–36:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And let me tell you about the thing that we do above that.

- [36:04–36:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Where is it?

- [36:05–36:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [36:06–36:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It goes to X.

- [36:08–36:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, OK.

- [36:09–36:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The lower one.

- [36:09–36:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You already know it.

- [36:10–36:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  This is weird.

- [36:11–36:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [36:16–36:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I heard somebody talk about, so do we want to have community

- [36:20–36:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  resources?

- [36:21–36:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like, do we want to have something behind the firewall?

- [36:28–36:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That was over here.

- [36:29–36:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We had it, the community resources for it.

- [36:33–36:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Because it's supposed to be for new people in the community,

- [36:35–36:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  right?

- [36:36–36:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [36:36–36:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Someone asked me the other day,

- [36:38–36:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  could you guys put on the website who our councilman is

- [36:41–36:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and where we belong?

- [36:42–36:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, me too.

- [36:44–36:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's all doable.

- [36:47–36:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's interesting.

- [36:48–36:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm thinking maybe you'll have to be managed by somebody.

- [36:54–36:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like, you have to have a board physician to manage that.

- [36:56–36:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Maybe 2.0.

- [36:58–37:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Because a welcome guide that would be a welcome guide,

- [37:00–37:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  because you have to be very careful that you're not

- [37:02–37:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  endorsing anybody that's saying where to vote and who's

- [37:07–37:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  your councilman.

- [37:08–37:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's one thing, of course, it has to be updated all the time.

- [37:11–37:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But you can't say like, who's your favorite dentist

- [37:14–37:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  or what and like that kind of stuff.

- [37:17–37:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I'm wondering if we could get around that,

- [37:21–37:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  because it is information that people want to know about having

- [37:23–37:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  a forum.

- [37:25–37:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, that's another idea.

- [37:26–37:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's kind of a forum where people

- [37:29–37:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  have postings that are up there.

- [37:31–37:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You do have to have moderation if you do that too.

- [37:33–37:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Because I was really hoping that when we needed to remodel

- [37:36–37:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  to rent a place that was from a newcomer,

- [37:39–37:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I really would have left to post that.

- [37:41–37:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Because I knew people were going to be gone or whatever.

- [37:43–37:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And we trust where they would be like, we can be tenants.

- [37:45–37:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But that wasn't available.

- [37:47–37:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But that's a lot of work.

- [37:48–37:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So that's 2.0, I think.

- [37:49–37:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's not a lie.

- [37:50–37:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [37:51–37:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That might be something that would

- [37:53–37:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  be better to put out for people who are lived in Santa Barbara.

- [37:56–37:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [37:57–37:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Holy, what's the best hairdresser?

- [37:58–38:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Everyone's like, I don't know, I just moved here.

- [38:00–38:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [38:01–38:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's true.

- [38:02–38:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's like a next door.

- [38:03–38:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What floor are you going to put a link to?

- [38:05–38:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm sure Santa Barbara has a best guide

- [38:07–38:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  at the independent publishers.

- [38:09–38:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Or Yelp reviews, things like that.

- [38:12–38:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Ask next door.

- [38:13–38:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [38:13–38:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I get asked that a lot.

- [38:15–38:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like, couldn't you do a recommended list on a really

- [38:18–38:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  hard, really hard, and dorsi business?

- [38:22–38:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  OK.

- [38:23–38:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So we're going to just do it.

- [38:24–38:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know if this is the list.

- [38:26–38:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes.

- [38:26–38:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So that would be like the list.

- [38:28–38:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [38:28–38:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's a church for a student.

- [38:30–38:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's a church bar on this page.

- [38:32–38:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes.

- [38:32–38:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [38:33–38:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Does it do anything?

- [38:34–38:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It does.

- [38:35–38:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Uh-huh.

- [38:35–38:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So for instance, I just, whoo, we just moved.

- [38:38–38:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We did?

- [38:39–38:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  People want.

- [38:40–38:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I just typed in Girls Night Out, for example,

- [38:42–38:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  for our previous discussion.

- [38:44–38:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And it gives you 3,000 hits on like every single day.

- [38:47–38:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mostly old.

- [38:49–38:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And it's not in any, I don't know, it's in date order,

- [38:52–38:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and then it's in reverse date order, because it's

- [38:54–38:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  one on schedule.

- [38:54–38:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  OK.

- [38:55–38:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You get a lot of stuff.

- [38:56–38:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But on the other hand, that I typed in bylaws,

- [38:58–39:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and it gave me like 16, and it would have taken me

- [39:01–39:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  to a place where the bylaws are.

- [39:03–39:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So let's leave that as fifth search, if we're going to have it.

- [39:06–39:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [39:06–39:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [39:07–39:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I don't know what you fixed, because it was finding.

- [39:10–39:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We have had requests for search, you know, early up front.

- [39:13–39:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, it's relevant to this.

- [39:14–39:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  On the nav side, for me, I would like, I love,

- [39:17–39:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  because keep in mind, we're behind the firewall.

- [39:20–39:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We're in the club.

- [39:21–39:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So this is like, if you remember, we're already club.

- [39:23–39:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Like, you're already in the club.

- [39:26–39:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  This is behind the firewall.

- [39:27–39:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I think like on the events or anything,

- [39:29–39:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  if I sign up for something, I would

- [39:31–39:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  love to have the function of add it to my calendar.

- [39:34–39:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It is on there.

- [39:36–39:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Isn't it?

- [39:37–39:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know.

- [39:38–39:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't use it any.

- [39:39–39:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know.

- [39:39–39:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It should be.

- [39:40–39:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, when you go.

- [39:41–39:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So I could add it to my exchange calendar.

- [39:44–39:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [39:44–39:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's in there?

- [39:45–39:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [39:45–39:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  OK, cool.

- [39:45–39:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [39:46–39:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Thank you.

- [39:46–39:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't use it.

- [39:47–39:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I use the app.

- [39:48–39:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [39:48–39:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I can't ever add it on the website.

- [39:52–39:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can add it, if you have a problem with it.

- [39:54–39:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So I don't really know if this is worthy of voting,

- [39:56–39:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but I guess we could talk about priorities.

- [39:58–40:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Is there something missing?

- [40:00–40:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can definitely skip one, because we're out of time.

- [40:03–40:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, you're out of time.

- [40:04–40:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We need it.

- [40:05–40:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Which one do we skip?

- [40:05–40:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I have a skipped.

- [40:07–40:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, I said, is there something missing from the nav?

- [40:11–40:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The volunteer's contact, because that's a picture.

- [40:14–40:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The one's in the hamburger.

- [40:15–40:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh.

- [40:15–40:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can put the volunteer in that resource.

- [40:18–40:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Somebody give me fun.

- [40:19–40:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We actually have a picture of somebody giving fun.

- [40:21–40:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  OK.

- [40:22–40:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Then you can explain what it is.

- [40:25–40:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'd like us to move on to the next talk.

- [40:28–40:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Just one other question that the navigation,

- [40:30–40:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  did we cover the search function?

- [40:32–40:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We said, add search function works.

- [40:34–40:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Either it works or kill it.

- [40:36–40:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It does work well.

- [40:37–40:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, it's not.

- [40:39–40:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They say it's good to kill it.

- [40:41–40:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They want it to work well.

- [40:42–40:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It depends on what we're looking for.

- [40:45–40:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I say, so this section is on visual branding

- [40:52–40:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and the feedback we got about it.

- [40:55–40:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And some of the things people said

- [40:58–40:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  it looks very dated.

- [40:59–41:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The website appears very dated.

- [41:01–41:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  When I looked at it, not having a header on top,

- [41:03–41:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  saying that it was the same problem with newcomers,

- [41:06–41:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you could mistake it for another website in Santa Barbara.

- [41:09–41:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The color scheme is not very inviting.

- [41:11–41:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And remember, the color scheme you're seeing there,

- [41:13–41:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  that happens to be our logo, which cannot be found on our website.

- [41:18–41:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It isn't on the website, but it's very vague and blurry.

- [41:21–41:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And you have to wait for the slideshow out pictures

- [41:23–41:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  to provide them with.

- [41:24–41:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  OK.

- [41:27–41:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You're using a basic font, use bold to highlight.

- [41:29–41:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think you could be using much newer and more

- [41:32–41:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  innovative ways to get people's attention.

- [41:34–41:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think the way it looks right now,

- [41:36–41:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  with just a white background and the white text boxes

- [41:38–41:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and black font, it's just not very inviting.

- [41:41–41:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So, you know, nothing new here.

- [41:43–41:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No, nothing new, sir.

- [41:44–41:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So our brand identity, who are we?

- [41:47–41:52]  
  **INSIGHT** · _Confidence: High_  
  And I'd like to give you some insight into who we might be.

- [41:58–42:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Is this where your invisible friend helped you?

- [42:01–42:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's the website.

- [42:08–42:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, screw you.

- [42:09–42:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can't hear it.

- [42:11–42:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  OK.

- [42:12–42:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm so disappointed that these are not working.

- [42:16–42:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's my fault.

- [42:17–42:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But let me explain what they are.

- [42:19–42:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There is, in the world of AI, there's

- [42:24–42:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  a wonderful company called 11 Labs.

- [42:26–42:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It does the voice of regions of New York Times

- [42:28–42:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  every morning and stuff like that.

- [42:30–42:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But another thing they do is they create jingles.

- [42:34–42:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And they have just this new demo thing that looks at your website

- [42:38–42:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and creates a jingle based upon your website.

- [42:41–42:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I will get these to you.

- [42:43–42:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I made a mistake in building this presentation.

- [42:46–42:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But they created jingles in various forms.

- [42:50–42:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we have a country style jingle.

- [42:53–42:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We have a Madison app jingle.

- [42:57–43:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We have a political ad jingle.

- [43:02–43:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it's really fun.

- [43:05–43:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I will send everyone the website and these things

- [43:08–43:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because they're fun to listen to.

- [43:11–43:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I'm very, very disappointed that they're not right here.

- [43:16–43:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So for member interviews, what our members

- [43:20–43:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  said they wanted us to be was a welcoming and fun community.

- [43:26–43:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So many activities, almost overwhelming.

- [43:31–43:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  A lot of the social events, but navigation is tricky.

- [43:35–43:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Instagram looks elegant.

- [43:36–43:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Website feels busy.

- [43:38–43:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Are we casual or sophisticated or both?

- [43:41–43:44]  
  **INSIGHT** · _Confidence: High_  
  But the key inside is members experience our brand differently

- [43:44–43:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  depending upon where they encounter us.

- [43:47–43:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Also, isn't that the beauty of choosing your own adventure?

- [43:51–43:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, it's kind of all of it.

- [43:53–43:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But also makes it confusing.

- [43:55–43:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, it's the brand.

- [43:56–43:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [43:57–43:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm sorry.

- [43:58–43:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Things...

- [43:59–44:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm pissed off.

- [44:01–44:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Things didn't come.

- [44:03–44:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Visually, they are censored or fun.

- [44:06–44:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They said polish graphics.

- [44:08–44:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's really not.

- [44:09–44:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But this is our Instagram.

- [44:12–44:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Our Instagram, you know, polish graphics, professional

- [44:15–44:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  photography, congratulations.

- [44:17–44:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You're a professional dinner.

- [44:19–44:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Curated lifestyle, magazine, aesthetic, tone of copy.

- [44:23–44:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Be involved in this life's vision.

- [44:25–44:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Friday equals funding with newcomers.

- [44:28–44:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Mineral texts, but visual storytelling.

- [44:30–44:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So basically an aspiration we find.

- [44:33–44:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And the target is to attract prospects with lifestyle appeal.

- [44:38–44:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Incidentally, that may be near attention,

- [44:41–44:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but that's also what our members felt about our Instagram.

- [44:46–44:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's like, that's nice to hear.

- [44:48–44:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's way fabulous.

- [44:50–44:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Thank you.

- [44:51–44:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  When you get to our website, it's lots of information, dense layouts,

- [44:57–44:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  exclamation points throughout.

- [44:59–45:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It says 645 pages of content,

- [45:02–45:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and that's just because all of the event pages and stuff like that.

- [45:06–45:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Our tone and copy make waves dining and joining us.

- [45:10–45:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No experience needed.

- [45:11–45:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Our levels welcome.

- [45:12–45:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Detailed descriptions.

- [45:13–45:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Specific adjustments.

- [45:17–45:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It says convert and inform with warmth and detail.

- [45:20–45:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I put more emphasis on the detail.

- [45:25–45:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But we do have a brand voice gap.

- [45:29–45:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  On Instagram, it's curated, elegant, mineral,

- [45:33–45:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  aspirational lifestyle, professional, polished.

- [45:36–45:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  On the way to site, it's something else.

- [45:39–45:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And the question is, is this kind of gap intentional,

- [45:43–45:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  or is it problematic?

- [45:45–45:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And does it confuse or does it serve different purposes?

- [45:49–45:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Later when we come to our discussion,

- [45:51–45:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  these are good things to think about.

- [45:56–45:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We do have two audiences.

- [45:59–46:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We have our public pages,

- [46:01–46:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and those are like our Instagram,

- [46:03–46:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  our homepage, our events calendar,

- [46:06–46:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  where our goal is to convert and attract new members.

- [46:10–46:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And what we need is clear value, easy to understand.

- [46:15–46:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Our member pages, where most of our content are,

- [46:19–46:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is to enable participation and connection.

- [46:22–46:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And the need there is easy navigation, clear next steps.

- [46:25–46:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And our current challenges,

- [46:27–46:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  both audiences see inconsistent brand voices,

- [46:31–46:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and navigation affects them both equally,

- [46:34–46:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  meaning it's equally bad on both sides.

- [46:37–46:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So kind of the questions for discussion,

- [46:40–46:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  as I pose them, are in our brand voice.

- [46:43–46:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Should we have one brand voice,

- [46:45–46:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  or is this bifurcated thing?

- [46:47–46:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Is there a good reason to do it?

- [46:50–46:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We're going to ask you sort of for one word

- [46:53–46:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that describes our personality.

- [46:56–46:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We're going to ask you, elegant or enthusiastic,

- [46:59–47:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  can we be both?

- [47:02–47:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Our visual identity.

- [47:05–47:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What should visitors and members see first?

- [47:08–47:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Does our current look match who we want to be,

- [47:12–47:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and I think we've already hit that question,

- [47:14–47:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and how do we balance polish and more?

- [47:18–47:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And also, these are audiences,

- [47:20–47:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  should there be different experiences?

- [47:23–47:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But this is a key word.

- [47:25–47:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What do we want people to feel when they get to that page?

- [47:28–47:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And really, I'm just posing the questions

- [47:31–47:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that a designer poses when you give them the assignment.

- [47:37–47:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And a really good exercise for getting into this

- [47:40–47:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is these kinds of questions.

- [47:43–47:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So if you were the Santa Barbara New Carers Club,

- [47:46–47:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  how would you introduce yourself to the party?

- [47:51–47:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  How would you dress for a first date?

- [47:54–47:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  How would you welcome a neighbor to your neighborhood?

- [47:58–48:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  How would I greet you at the front door?

- [48:03–48:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And so I think I've posed a bunch of questions here,

- [48:06–48:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and I'll leave it to Jan to solicit your thoughts on this,

- [48:10–48:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because I can tell you, if we engage a designer

- [48:13–48:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to work with us on this,

- [48:15–48:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  this is going to be what they're going to want to have

- [48:22–48:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  before they'll do anything.

- [48:25–48:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  If there's an argument,

- [48:27–48:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but they don't ask for this, then you don't want them.

- [48:30–48:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's a newcomer who does this for a living.

- [48:33–48:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's a brand name?

- [48:35–48:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Her name is Patricia Babuka.

- [48:38–48:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I wish they were here.

- [48:41–48:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I just learned that about her a little while ago.

- [48:46–48:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I think we just want to get the...

- [48:49–48:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We've talked about a lot of this information over here,

- [48:52–48:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  fun, welcoming, engaging, diverse age group,

- [48:57–48:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  not all old people,

- [48:59–49:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but why don't we throw out a few of the directions

- [49:01–49:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that we would give to any kind of designer?

- [49:04–49:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think a good thing would be to go around the room

- [49:06–49:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and do the one word, and everyone just gives their word.

- [49:09–49:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay, one word to describe SB Newcomers.

- [49:16–49:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [49:33–49:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Others?

- [49:34–49:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Some.

- [49:35–49:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [49:38–49:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Fascinating.

- [49:42–49:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Education.

- [49:46–49:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm dull now, so it's welcoming.

- [49:48–49:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We got that, times two, okay?

- [49:50–49:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [49:51–49:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Exciting.

- [49:52–49:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [49:55–49:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Who hasn't after that?

- [49:57–49:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I was saying fun.

- [49:59–50:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I have it.

- [50:00–50:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean...

- [50:02–50:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think...

- [50:05–50:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think the club, I used to...

- [50:07–50:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think about it as a gateway.

- [50:09–50:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I mean, it's a gateway to friends,

- [50:11–50:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  it's a gateway to learning about the community,

- [50:13–50:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  it's a gateway to...

- [50:16–50:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Learn about yourself.

- [50:18–50:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Huh?

- [50:19–50:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Learn about yourself.

- [50:20–50:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No.

- [50:22–50:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But it's a gateway to my new community

- [50:24–50:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  through my things.

- [50:25–50:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's not an inspiring word.

- [50:27–50:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's what it is.

- [50:30–50:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [50:32–50:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  New friends there in my community, okay?

- [50:34–50:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Leslie, have you done it?

- [50:36–50:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No, I'm just nodding at all of these things.

- [50:39–50:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Nodding?

- [50:40–50:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Time's up.

- [50:42–50:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think I would go with Friendly too.

- [50:44–50:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Friendly? Okay.

- [50:49–50:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [50:50–50:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I think that we could say

- [50:51–50:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that our current website doesn't communicate this

- [50:53–50:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  with the white in terms of...

- [50:56–50:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But Instagram does.

- [50:58–51:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And the new things we're thinking about

- [51:01–51:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  will definitely do this

- [51:02–51:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  with photos of people having a great time

- [51:04–51:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and serving the community, et cetera.

- [51:07–51:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So...

- [51:08–51:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So you would tell us like, tone it?

- [51:10–51:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So like, what is...

- [51:12–51:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [51:15–51:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So, the kind of next question?

- [51:17–51:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [51:18–51:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The next question is,

- [51:20–51:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  someone just moved in

- [51:22–51:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  to the next store.

- [51:25–51:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And...

- [51:27–51:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you want to tell them,

- [51:30–51:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  you know, they're in a hurry,

- [51:32–51:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  you know, they're supervising the movers and whatever,

- [51:34–51:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  so you can't spend much time.

- [51:36–51:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But in a sentence,

- [51:37–51:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  you want to tell them about new covers.

- [51:42–51:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What's your sentence?

- [51:46–51:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Oh, connection.

- [51:48–51:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The word I was thinking about.

- [51:56–51:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Thank you.

- [51:58–52:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's a great way to meet people.

- [52:00–52:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Thank you.

- [52:01–52:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's a great way to meet people.

- [52:03–52:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [52:06–52:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's what I would say.

- [52:10–52:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And also learn about...

- [52:12–52:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  how you got your channel.

- [52:14–52:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [52:16–52:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  To become part of the community.

- [52:18–52:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [52:19–52:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yep.

- [52:20–52:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The community of the people in the town

- [52:22–52:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  as well as the community.

- [52:25–52:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [52:28–52:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm.

- [52:45–52:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Sign here.

- [52:48–52:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [52:53–52:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Where else?

- [52:58–53:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And if I'm only got a minute, then I say,

- [53:00–53:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  you know, you would really like to be posting a chair.

- [53:06–53:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's a great way.

- [53:07–53:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's a great way. I got it.

- [53:08–53:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [53:09–53:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Maybe you can become president.

- [53:17–53:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know.

- [53:18–53:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And it's all of the same things in college,

- [53:20–53:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but less school.

- [53:25–53:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That would be a big testimony.

- [53:26–53:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Mm-hmm.

- [53:33–53:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I could have described the club every month

- [53:35–53:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  with orientation.

- [53:36–53:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I had it last year, right?

- [53:37–53:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I was just like, it's...

- [53:39–53:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  we all moved here in the same boat.

- [53:41–53:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I always like to tell a story.

- [53:42–53:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  When we were here, I knew no one.

- [53:44–53:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You know, later I had a fight at my house

- [53:46–53:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and I had a number of people there.

- [53:48–53:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it's not because I'm this really great guy.

- [53:51–53:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's because I've met a lot of people through this club.

- [53:54–53:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I never really had that opportunity

- [53:56–53:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  if we hadn't done it.

- [53:57–53:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And how else can you meet people

- [53:59–54:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and learn about the community?

- [54:01–54:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like...

- [54:02–54:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I could have...

- [54:03–54:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I could have sent my commission statement to the club.

- [54:05–54:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like, we were here to make friends.

- [54:08–54:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's a very simple mission statement.

- [54:10–54:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  When I first put around the covers,

- [54:12–54:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  it was while I was cleaning my mouth

- [54:14–54:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  on my dentist.

- [54:15–54:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And it was the dentist who was telling me,

- [54:17–54:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you just moved here.

- [54:19–54:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And he said, same thing.

- [54:20–54:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We moved here.

- [54:21–54:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We didn't know anybody.

- [54:22–54:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And we just had a Labor Day farm que

- [54:24–54:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  in our house.

- [54:25–54:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And 50 people showed up.

- [54:26–54:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And then we're all people.

- [54:27–54:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We need to do that.

- [54:28–54:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We moved here.

- [54:29–54:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm like, that's the same exact thing.

- [54:31–54:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What's your story?

- [54:34–54:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  One of the things I actually say

- [54:36–54:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  is I lived here before.

- [54:38–54:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And when I moved here before,

- [54:40–54:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I wasn't a member of Newcomers.

- [54:42–54:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And what I say is,

- [54:43–54:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  it took me about four years

- [54:45–54:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  before I felt this was my town.

- [54:48–54:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I knew what was going on here.

- [54:50–54:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  With Newcomers,

- [54:51–54:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that's reduced it by four months.

- [54:54–54:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You can make this your town.

- [54:58–55:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Celebrate your...

- [55:00–55:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  custom lower field work.

- [55:02–55:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [55:09–55:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think we have a lot of consistency here,

- [55:11–55:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  which is good, you know?

- [55:13–55:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You just need to be communicated.

- [55:17–55:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  All right.

- [55:18–55:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's a fast way to make a community

- [55:20–55:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  that has been abandoned yet, I think.

- [55:24–55:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:26–55:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [55:27–55:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:28–55:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:29–55:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:30–55:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:31–55:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:32–55:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:33–55:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:34–55:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It's sad.

- [55:35–55:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [55:36–55:38]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  I don't understand what that is.

  gateonticmatch.com

- [55:39–55:41]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  I don't maybe not.

- [55:41–55:43]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  It's a hate, an adventure.

- [55:46–55:47]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  So, I...

- [55:47–55:48]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  I think that we've kinda gotten

- [55:48–55:49]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  what we wanted out of this meeting.

- [55:49–55:50]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  I really appreciate everybody's effort,

- [55:50–55:53]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  and tucks if anyone has any problems.

- [55:53–55:55]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  No, I have no emotions.

- [55:55–55:57]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  I don't even know what to get through to.

- [55:57–55:58]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  Well, one thing in design thinking

- [55:58–55:59]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  that we do say is like,

- [55:59–56:00]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  is there anything we haven't covered

- [56:00–56:02]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  that you want to bring up?

- [56:02–56:04]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  That's a key interviewing tool,

- [56:04–56:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  of viewing tool because if there's been something like,

- [56:06–56:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  when is this, what is this?

- [56:07–56:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Is there something you haven't covered?

- [56:09–56:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We have our paper.

- [56:10–56:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Get it right now.

- [56:12–56:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Put it in there in priority.

- [56:14–56:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I have something.

- [56:14–56:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes.

- [56:15–56:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I always figured that one of the big challenges

- [56:18–56:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  one of the objectives is to get the movies engaged.

- [56:22–56:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You know, the posting committee,

- [56:24–56:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I see how they set up the tickets and all that.

- [56:26–56:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [56:27–56:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I always figured that they ought to get some slots

- [56:30–56:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  ahead of everybody rather than just being taken

- [56:33–56:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  first off the table.

- [56:34–56:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [56:36–56:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Which is easy to do with the tickets.

- [56:38–56:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You just say, okay, a quarter of a month,

- [56:40–56:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  they can sign up first.

- [56:42–56:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yep.

- [56:43–56:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I was just looking at it.

- [56:45–56:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  He seemed frustrated that everybody's jumping in

- [56:48–56:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and you know, yeah.

- [56:50–56:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Joining the club and all the good stuff's filling in.

- [56:52–56:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know if we're tracking how many people ended up

- [56:54–56:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  on the waitlist for events.

- [56:56–56:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You know, look at how many are full,

- [56:58–57:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but how many couldn't get in.

- [57:00–57:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [57:02–57:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You know, something we got to be attentive to.

- [57:03–57:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Talk to the chairs about it.

- [57:05–57:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think they started,

- [57:05–57:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  like I was intentional with the mass grade ball.

- [57:08–57:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right?

- [57:09–57:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  If you look at mass grade ball,

- [57:11–57:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  before you, those tickets are with movies right now.

- [57:13–57:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right?

- [57:14–57:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Which I want to see that.

- [57:15–57:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right?

- [57:16–57:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I can't hold tickets anymore

- [57:17–57:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  for people who haven't joined the club.

- [57:20–57:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Right?

- [57:20–57:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Because it's a hot ticket.

- [57:22–57:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But have we been holding tickets

- [57:24–57:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  like doing this, giving them like a head start?

- [57:28–57:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We don't do that.

- [57:29–57:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No.

- [57:30–57:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No.

- [57:31–57:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You're good.

- [57:31–57:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, if you were to see the chair.

- [57:33–57:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I know we can, but I don't think we do.

- [57:35–57:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think it comes down to chair or public Sunday.

- [57:39–57:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [57:40–57:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, that's what I was thinking.

- [57:41–57:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Actually, it's not a day, right?

- [57:42–57:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They're the first off from waitlist.

- [57:44–57:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, you can be like,

- [57:45–57:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  let's say we're going to do 25 pieces of the video.

- [57:49–57:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can save five of these tickets for news.

- [57:51–57:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But not for chairs.

- [57:52–57:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I just want to bring this up

- [57:54–57:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  because John and I both have the same thoughts

- [57:56–57:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  at the same time.

- [57:58–58:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  In a funny world, we see all this on Sundays

- [58:00–58:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and to this point, why can't we set,

- [58:02–58:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  why can't the newbies sign up on Sunday

- [58:04–58:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and everyone else has to roll into Tuesday?

- [58:06–58:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  To my work and committee.

- [58:07–58:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [58:08–58:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It feels like something.

- [58:09–58:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  It feels like something.

- [58:10–58:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, work and committee.

- [58:11–58:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, work and committee.

- [58:11–58:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Next question.

- [58:12–58:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Next question.

- [58:13–58:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Next question.

- [58:14–58:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Next question.

- [58:15–58:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [58:16–58:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And posting chair can sign up at any time.

- [58:18–58:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Exactly.

- [58:19–58:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  These are the logistics problem,

- [58:21–58:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  or is it just an education problem

- [58:22–58:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  where the chairs just need to know

- [58:23–58:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  that they can have to get the chair?

- [58:25–58:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can set that up.

- [58:25–58:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, we can set that up.

- [58:26–58:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can set that up.

- [58:27–58:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can set that up.

- [58:28–58:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can set that up.

- [58:29–58:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We can set that up.

- [58:30–58:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What can you do?

- [58:31–58:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [58:32–58:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can have designated newbie tickets

- [58:33–58:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  so that you can come by a space

- [58:35–58:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and set up a newbie ticket.

- [58:36–58:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, what I'm saying is,

- [58:37–58:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  the newbie ticket would be,

- [58:38–58:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you get it in a bag.

- [58:39–58:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yes.

- [58:40–58:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And then you have a regular ticket

- [58:41–58:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  that includes newbies.

- [58:42–58:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [58:43–58:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think if you sign up early,

- [58:45–58:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  they can still sign up.

- [58:45–58:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They don't want to take a chance

- [58:46–58:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  right now.

- [58:47–58:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You could do that.

- [58:48–58:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think you could still keep the numbers.

- [58:49–58:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, you could.

- [58:50–58:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You could as totally set per second,

- [58:52–58:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but you could also just have newbies.

- [58:53–58:54]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Think of working committee.

- [58:54–58:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You just have newbies.

- [58:55–58:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [58:56–58:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know.

- [58:57–58:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I see what you've done.

- [58:58–58:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Lemonade and a number of newbies.

- [58:59–59:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Not necessarily.

- [59:00–59:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Because what if, let's say you've got

- [59:02–59:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  70 tickets ignored or you can get 70 tickets.

- [59:05–59:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You set them on the 70s bill.

- [59:08–59:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And then you just set newbies to start on the 70s.

- [59:10–59:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So all the newbies get for show?

- [59:11–59:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They can't.

- [59:13–59:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Now, the downside there would be

- [59:15–59:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  if all the newbies sign up right away,

- [59:17–59:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  then the newcomers are out.

- [59:18–59:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But we could also adjust the numbers of the newbies.

- [59:20–59:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Honestly, for games,

- [59:22–59:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  we have like 10 people.

- [59:24–59:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [59:24–59:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I guess they don't pay too much.

- [59:26–59:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So that's it.

- [59:27–59:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [59:27–59:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  One second.

- [59:28–59:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Let's just break the closure.

- [59:30–59:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Functionally, that exists today.

- [59:35–59:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think we have an education challenge,

- [59:37–59:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  which goes from,

- [59:39–59:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  which is why usability is so important with the tools

- [59:42–59:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because every six months we've got turnover.

- [59:44–59:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But yeah, the reality of it is 14%

- [59:47–59:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  of the people in the club right now

- [59:49–59:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  have been here less than 90 days.

- [59:51–59:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And they joined the club

- [59:54–59:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and a lot of the good stuff is full.

- [59:58–60:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  As someone who ran membership for six months

- [60:01–60:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and now has been the president for six,

- [60:03–60:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I go to the orientations.

- [60:05–60:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I see it in their faces.

- [60:06–60:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I hear it and if we,

- [60:09–60:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think there's a,

- [60:10–60:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  we can do it.

- [60:11–60:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The technology is today to do it.

- [60:13–60:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think it's an education and communication challenge,

- [60:16–60:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but we could do it today.

- [60:18–60:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I was wrong.

- [60:19–60:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [60:19–60:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We can't reserve tickets for newbies,

- [60:22–60:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but we could open the window for them sooner

- [60:26–60:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  or separately.

- [60:27–60:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [60:28–60:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There are other ways of addressing it.

- [60:30–60:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Sure.

- [60:31–60:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Give them a head start,

- [60:32–60:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  but you can't reserve.

- [60:34–60:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So we just gotta find an easy way to do it

- [60:36–60:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  so that people can have a gateway to make it happen.

- [60:38–60:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [60:39–60:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So I mean,

- [60:40–60:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  if people knew that they had a head start,

- [60:43–60:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  they're not going to do something

- [60:44–60:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and you can advertise that

- [60:45–60:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and we can put it in the newsletter.

- [60:47–60:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [60:48–60:49]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm going to do the other scope.

- [60:49–60:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [60:52–60:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Because I did tell you,

- [60:53–60:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you could leave by nine o'clock

- [60:55–60:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and they're passed.

- [60:57–60:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I don't want to get you away

- [60:59–60:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  without engaging you.

- [60:59–61:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Five to nine.

- [61:01–61:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [61:02–61:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I told you you had two minutes last night, Ed,

- [61:04–61:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and you took seven.

- [61:04–61:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You did, I noticed that.

- [61:06–61:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I did too.

- [61:07–61:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And because of that,

- [61:08–61:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I couldn't let Curt Munger talk

- [61:09–61:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  about the storage facility.

- [61:11–61:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [61:13–61:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Fast.

- [61:15–61:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There's always next month.

- [61:16–61:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [61:19–61:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The goal I'm kind of set for the project

- [61:22–61:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  without trying to see

- [61:24–61:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  is that I would like us to be able

- [61:25–61:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to have prototypes done

- [61:28–61:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  by our next board meeting on December 8th.

- [61:31–61:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's very tight,

- [61:33–61:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but I think we can do it.

- [61:35–61:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What that means is a series of things

- [61:39–61:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  between now and then.

- [61:42–61:44]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We're doing our workshop today.

- [61:44–61:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We're going to have,

- [61:46–61:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm proposing we have a prototype strength

- [61:48–61:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  where people...

- [61:50–61:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  During Thanksgiving?

- [61:52–61:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yes.

- [61:53–61:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We're not going to be working together.

- [61:55–61:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They're going to have fun.

- [61:57–61:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You're not going to be working together.

- [61:59–62:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm not.

- [62:00–62:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm just going to not work on this.

- [62:02–62:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You're not going to have fun.

- [62:04–62:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We're out of this.

- [62:06–62:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Have another check,

- [62:07–62:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  have a check-in meeting.

- [62:08–62:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Maybe I don't have the dates quite right.

- [62:10–62:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I forgot about Thanksgiving.

- [62:13–62:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Go out and actually test our prototypes

- [62:16–62:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and talk to some people and show it to them

- [62:18–62:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and prepare for a board meeting on December 8th.

- [62:21–62:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But really make some progress.

- [62:23–62:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Not implementation progress,

- [62:26–62:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but progress in prototyping.

- [62:28–62:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  By the way,

- [62:28–62:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  the best prototypes are the least detailed prototypes,

- [62:34–62:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  the least finished looking prototypes.

- [62:37–62:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They're sketches.

- [62:38–62:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They can be pencil sketches

- [62:42–62:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because if you bring in a really sophisticated prototype,

- [62:45–62:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  people are afraid to offer their candid views.

- [62:51–62:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Your goal with a prototype is to get feedback.

- [62:56–63:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Your goal isn't to sell the design you have.

- [63:00–63:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we're not asking you to have art director stuff.

- [63:05–63:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We're asking you to have sketches that indicate your ideas.

- [63:10–63:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So then just December 8th is that presentation

- [63:14–63:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  of the prototype for feedback?

- [63:16–63:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Or is it a person that don't need?

- [63:18–63:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Let's get on the same page.

- [63:21–63:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  One, we're not taking much feedback from 680 people.

- [63:25–63:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You want to drag this thing out for the next three years?

- [63:28–63:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Ask 680 people what they think about it.

- [63:30–63:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I didn't say 680 people.

- [63:31–63:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm just saying, no, I get it.

- [63:33–63:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I just, you have to show your prototypes to some people

- [63:38–63:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  because egocentric design is the very least.

- [63:41–63:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Fair enough.

- [63:42–63:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm not advocating, we just jailed on something.

- [63:44–63:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I was asking the question as to what they,

- [63:47–63:49]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but what I am saying, well, here's the thing.

- [63:49–63:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  By December 8th, here's what's happening on December 8th.

- [63:52–63:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We're presenting a slate of officers for the new term.

- [63:57–63:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's not going to take a long time

- [63:58–63:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because you don't really vote.

- [63:59–64:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It's an unanimous thing.

- [64:01–64:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like nobody ever says I'm not voting for that person.

- [64:03–64:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I've never seen that, right?

- [64:05–64:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Like, it's just happening.

- [64:06–64:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we got time to do it.

- [64:08–64:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We should do it.

- [64:09–64:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But I think we can move beyond sketches though,

- [64:12–64:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  like with tools like chat and Gemini,

- [64:17–64:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I mean, you literally could have something to show.

- [64:21–64:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  By the board meeting, we will have something to show.

- [64:25–64:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But for the prototyping phase and showing it to people,

- [64:28–64:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  sketches are better than working, you know, applications.

- [64:36–64:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I mean, if you want to do design thinking, that's for you.

- [64:40–64:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm in line, trust me.

- [64:41–64:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I can find a new president and new piece of activity.

- [64:43–64:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I can't do it, but I'm just saying,

- [64:48–64:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think that, I think you have the time to do it.

- [64:52–64:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I just think that you could optically show some of it.

- [64:55–64:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Does that mean we could get pen and paper out?

- [64:57–64:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Or can I kind of play with the mock-up on the computer screen?

- [64:59–65:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You can play with the mock-up on the computer screen.

- [65:01–65:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Gem, just don't make it look like

- [65:04–65:09]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I put my heart and soul into this thing.

- [65:09–65:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it's very precious to me.

- [65:12–65:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Because if you do that, you won't,

- [65:15–65:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  you really won't continue in feedback.

- [65:17–65:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I just got one.

- [65:18–65:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But it can have, it can have some kind of polish.

- [65:21–65:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It doesn't have to be, because it doesn't have to work.

- [65:23–65:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's the thing, it doesn't have to work.

- [65:24–65:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I don't know exactly what it's like.

- [65:25–65:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What I'm trying to say is these prototypes

- [65:29–65:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  don't need to have a lot of depth and detailing.

- [65:33–65:37]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They need to be something to communicate a concept.

- [65:38–65:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You know, someone can say, yeah, I like that.

- [65:40–65:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's a really good direction.

- [65:42–65:45]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Are you assigning those to different pages?

- [65:45–65:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm trying to decide.

- [65:46–65:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  OK.

- [65:48–65:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What I think we want to have is three teams.

- [65:53–65:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And this could be a Zoom meeting.

- [65:57–66:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  This is the three team.

- [66:00–66:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm sorry.

- [66:02–66:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We have three teams.

- [66:08–66:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I think one team is really about the navigation

- [66:15–66:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and the pages.

- [66:17–66:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What the overall navigation is, what each page should do.

- [66:22–66:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it's not necessarily the look and feel of the page.

- [66:27–66:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And frankly, it can be descriptive in words.

- [66:32–66:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It can be what job is this page designed to do

- [66:36–66:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and what's our collection of pages.

- [66:41–66:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The second area is brand voice as distilling the brand voice.

- [66:47–66:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it would be great, frankly, if we

- [66:51–66:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  could get this down to a page or even plan

- [66:54–66:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  by the end of this project to get

- [66:55–67:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to what's called a brand book or brand guideline, which

- [67:01–67:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  has our artifacts and has our key messages

- [67:07–67:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and has that stuff.

- [67:12–67:16]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And then the third thing, because it's a very special area,

- [67:16–67:18]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is the event discovery area.

- [67:18–67:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  If we look at where our users spend their time

- [67:21–67:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and where we get the most feedback,

- [67:24–67:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  it's in events.

- [67:27–67:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  How do I find events?

- [67:29–67:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  How do I sign up for events?

- [67:32–67:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  It has to do with events.

- [67:34–67:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I really like if we could have a team looking and thinking

- [67:40–67:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  deeply and coming up with some prototypes of what

- [67:46–67:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  our member interface to events should do.

- [67:50–67:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What jobs it should do.

- [67:53–67:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Sure.

- [67:58–68:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What I envision our next meeting is being,

- [68:01–68:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and we'll look at the dates because Thanksgiving is

- [68:03–68:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  a fair concern, but just to present these things,

- [68:10–68:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  get feedback from the group, and make some decisions

- [68:14–68:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  as to the things that we're going to develop into something

- [68:17–68:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to show at the board meeting.

- [68:24–68:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I think we haven't discussed it.

- [68:28–68:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm of the opinion, if we don't have a member who's

- [68:32–68:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  a designer who's willing to take this on as a project,

- [68:35–68:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that we hire a designer for a modest fee.

- [68:41–68:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But we really have them focus not on a full website design

- [68:48–68:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  or writing content or implementing code,

- [68:51–68:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but on a narrow set of things.

- [68:55–69:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Taking that set of ideas that come out of our prototypes

- [69:03–69:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and actually turning those into real things

- [69:08–69:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  we can present to the board.

- [69:10–69:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They don't need to be fully functional,

- [69:12–69:14]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but they need to be a storyboard.

- [69:14–69:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Here's what the new website will look like.

- [69:16–69:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The designer should work on our branding guide,

- [69:22–69:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because we all need to agree on what our brand is before we

- [69:26–69:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  can really move into implementation.

- [69:30–69:35]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We need to mock up what our new navigation is going to be.

- [69:35–69:40]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And this is just like, we need to make sure that whatever we do

- [69:40–69:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is mobile responsive, because we've

- [69:41–69:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  seen that a third of our use is our website on mobile devices.

- [69:47–69:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And frankly, I'd like to encourage our app use

- [69:50–69:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to be our mobile website.

- [69:53–69:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And there are ways to design websites

- [69:57–70:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that they automatically work on mobile.

- [70:00–70:02]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And it's really important for us to do that,

- [70:02–70:06]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  because otherwise we'll be forever managing

- [70:06–70:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  two different websites.

- [70:08–70:11]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So just on the other thing, I've set aside $5,000

- [70:11–70:13]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  for this project in the budget.

- [70:13–70:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I did it at the beginning of the term.

- [70:15–70:19]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So we have five G's built into the budget

- [70:19–70:22]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to make the website experience better.

- [70:22–70:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So I think we've got the dollars to cover it.

- [70:25–70:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  When we built it into the budget, it's money we should spend.

- [70:32–70:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's two members that are designers, you're saying?

- [70:36–70:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But don't they need to be able to write code?

- [70:38–70:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Don't they need to be able to work in?

- [70:39–70:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  They don't have to be able to write code in?

- [70:43–70:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I absolutely don't want to just lay it out.

- [70:46–70:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  OK, so we just need designers.

- [70:48–70:51]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We don't need content management people.

- [70:51–70:53]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We have our content management system.

- [70:53–70:56]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's one thing that's not going to change.

- [70:56–70:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  No, I understand that.

- [70:57–71:01]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  If a designer turns the designs over to the club,

- [71:01–71:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  we've got people that can turn that into reality?

- [71:04–71:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah.

- [71:05–71:07]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  What is it on the website developers?

- [71:07–71:08]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  WallApers.

- [71:08–71:09]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  It's not really.

- [71:09–71:11]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  It's a content management system.

- [71:11–71:13]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  You can see a lot of designers.

- [71:13–71:15]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  You can see a lot of CMSs WallApers.

- [71:15–71:17]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  Yeah, content management systems.

- [71:17–71:18]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  You can see a lot of applications.

- [71:18–71:21]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  And you can have these built-in gadgets.

- [71:21–71:26]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  So that's one that we can use from a great application.

- [71:26–71:27]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  No, not that.

- [71:27–71:33]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  So you can really abstract and look and feel and also

- [71:33–71:34]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  access it together.

- [71:34–71:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So you can really abstract and look and feel

- [71:37–71:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and the technology.

- [71:38–71:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [71:38–71:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So this could be a type or like if we went on.

- [71:41–71:44]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There should be a risk in the calendar control.

- [71:44–71:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We should do a perfect concept for that.

- [71:46–71:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, that's very good.

- [71:48–71:51]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So that's a yes and OK.

- [71:51–71:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Is that a yes?

- [71:52–71:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What?

- [71:53–71:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You should do a perfect concept so we know what we're talking about.

- [71:55–71:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I understand that, like, if we have a designer design

- [71:59–72:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  and we're going to hand that work over to someone

- [72:03–72:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  who's going to bring that to life.

- [72:04–72:08]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I think the bring to life really

- [72:08–72:15]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  can be among people in this room, I'm confident.

- [72:15–72:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And if not, we may have to come to you

- [72:21–72:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and expand the budget to hire someone

- [72:23–72:25]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to help with implementation.

- [72:25–72:27]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  But I really don't think that's the case.

- [72:27–72:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Wait, is it true that our whole website is

- [72:30–72:31]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  designed on Wild Apricot?

- [72:31–72:34]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Or is Wild Apricot an API that's populating information?

- [72:34–72:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So let me explain.

- [72:36–72:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Did you just answer that?

- [72:38–72:43]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Yeah, Wild Apricot has built into it

- [72:43–72:46]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  a really lame authoring system.

- [72:46–72:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And what that authoring system uses to create the pages

- [72:52–72:57]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  is a bunch of gadgets, which are things you can plug into pages

- [72:57–72:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  and configure it.

- [72:58–72:59]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Wix.

- [73:00–73:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Widgets, exactly.

- [73:03–73:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And those widgets are somewhat configurable,

- [73:05–73:07]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  like our calendar is a widget.

- [73:07–73:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Their calendar widget will not do what we want it to do.

- [73:10–73:17]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  However, there are APIs to Wild Apricot

- [73:17–73:20]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  that allow you to take Wild Apricot data.

- [73:20–73:23]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So for example, there are a bunch of third-party calendar

- [73:23–73:26]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  widgets that work with that Wild Apricot.

- [73:27–73:32]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  One of those may be good enough to meet our needs.

- [73:32–73:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  You can use plain old HTML and use JavaScript or React

- [73:41–73:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  to actually build pages and just pull in data from Wild Apricot.

- [73:47–73:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  There's a full read-write API.

- [73:52–73:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  However, the more we come out of the Wild Apricot authoring

- [73:58–74:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  system, the greater burden we put on future VPs of technology.

- [74:06–74:08]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So that's the real trade-off.

- [74:08–74:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, so don't throw it in your container.

- [74:10–74:12]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, the maintenance burden.

- [74:12–74:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Although, just everyone knows, Wild Apricot doesn't maintain.

- [74:17–74:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You know?

- [74:18–74:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Right.

- [74:19–74:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [74:20–74:24]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I mean, I'm not saying it's not nice to have them maintain things,

- [74:24–74:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  but the value added is low.

- [74:28–74:33]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  My concern, actually, if we implement our own web pages

- [74:33–74:36]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  six months from now, someone wants to change them,

- [74:36–74:38]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  we need somebody who's able to do that.

- [74:38–74:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We need a web developer.

- [74:39–74:39]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  That's true.

- [74:39–74:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  So the more we can use just out-of-box, Wild Apricot

- [74:42–74:47]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  functionality, similar to Wix, that will be advantageous.

- [74:47–74:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So we may want to factor in time with the designer.

- [74:50–74:53]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  For, fine, let's get what the designer's stress.

- [74:53–74:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Then we need a site to kind of investigate the feasibility of that.

- [74:57–74:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Absolutely.

- [74:57–75:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We may need to go back to the designer then and say, hey,

- [75:00–75:01]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  you can't hear the limitations.

- [75:01–75:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Absolutely.

- [75:02–75:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, we need to know the limitations.

- [75:04–75:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [75:05–75:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, I mean, I can put you all in the well.

- [75:10–75:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  When you think about the Wild Apricot authoring system,

- [75:14–75:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  don't think about Wix.

- [75:16–75:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Think about net objects circa 1997.

- [75:23–75:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, yeah, of course.

- [75:24–75:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Of course.

- [75:25–75:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, I got you.

- [75:26–75:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm not sure.

- [75:27–75:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't even know.

- [75:30–75:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Net objects.

- [75:31–75:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, it's one of the reasons we have what we have is it fits

- [75:42–75:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  very nicely into what Wild Apricot wants to produce.

- [75:46–75:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  The reason why our pages, if you have a wide window on the screen,

- [75:52–75:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  have one space on both sides, has to do with the way Wild Apricot works.

- [75:57–76:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't even think Wild Apricot uses CSS.

- [76:00–76:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, I think that it's really pretty.

- [76:02–76:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  There were no 910.

- [76:04–76:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, yeah, that's it.

- [76:05–76:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's it.

- [76:05–76:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's the letter.

- [76:06–76:09]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Should we start with this fact about how or what the limitations are?

- [76:09–76:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, I think that's a fair point.

- [76:11–76:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I can also say one second.

- [76:14–76:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Pretty meant to be.

- [76:15–76:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You can.

- [76:16–76:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I just don't want to bring this back.

- [76:17–76:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  No, it doesn't matter.

- [76:19–76:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think we work through it.

- [76:20–76:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Let's not let our stuff limit our thinking.

- [76:23–76:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And that's why we wanted a tight scope.

- [76:26–76:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I love to work with scrappy pilots, and I'd love to run that way versus trying
  to

- [76:33–76:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  bowl the ocean.

- [76:34–76:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  So if our scope is tight, and let's make six or seven things better, that's a
  win.

- [76:40–76:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And I don't know that we're limited in getting that game.

- [76:43–76:48]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  We might not have this aspirational thing that we all want and desire, but let's
  go

- [76:48–76:52]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  find those wins and get peddling against it.

- [76:52–76:54]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I know we can do that.

- [76:54–76:58]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And that's what I'm so thankful for.

- [76:58–77:03]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And I know to get those quick wins, Coriander, we can work with what we got.

- [77:03–77:05]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  And we'll make it better.

- [77:05–77:10]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  I'm just thinking in terms of this next stage, where we're sketching, so we're
  sketching

- [77:10–77:13]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  with the limitations that we don't know what they are yet.

- [77:13–77:14]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But that's what we're doing.

- [77:14–77:16]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We're doing it vague, so it's okay.

- [77:16–77:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Tomorrow morning, I will be able to send you something that will communicate the
  limitations.

- [77:21–77:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [77:22–77:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I think you're right, though.

- [77:23–77:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Love it.

- [77:24–77:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Love it.

- [77:25–77:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  But I'd really like to leave us with having everyone who's willing, because this
  is not

- [77:33–77:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  a draft, have signed up to be on one of these working groups.

- [77:40–77:50]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Group one is going to deal with the navigation and what each page's mission is.

- [77:50–77:55]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What it contains, what job it has to do.

- [77:55–78:00]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Two is, who are we?

- [78:00–78:04]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  What do we want to look like and sound like to people?

- [78:04–78:12]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Group three is just deep diving on the whole events thing, because the whole
  events thing

- [78:12–78:21]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  probably is, unless we can use one of the other calendars that are out there, it
  is technically

- [78:21–78:28]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  the most complex piece of everything we're talking about.

- [78:28–78:29]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Sure.

- [78:29–78:30]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Thank you very much.

- [78:30–78:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  This is a huge thing you two tackle, and we're going to try to do it proud.

- [78:40–78:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'll sign up for two.

- [78:42–78:43]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay?

- [78:43–78:48]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I mean, we're willing where we will sign up for stuff, like I can get involved
  in two.

- [78:48–78:50]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm doing two.

- [78:50–78:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I did, and I'll sign up.

- [78:52–79:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay, we have two, we've got Steve, Dana.

- [79:02–79:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I don't know which ones.

- [79:05–79:07]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  They're on two.

- [79:07–79:15]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, but I would love to have someone on that with us who's not living in our
  household.

- [79:15–79:17]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'll deal with you there.

- [79:17–79:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay, good.

- [79:18–79:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  You're going to get our household.

- [79:21–79:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  That's okay.

- [79:22–79:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  We've seen evidence that it's not unanimous.

- [79:25–79:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  What about, who wants to work on one?

- [79:28–79:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Navigation.

- [79:29–79:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  John, okay.

- [79:30–79:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Can you seem to know the most about every page?

- [79:37–79:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Can you do one?

- [79:38–79:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I was going to say, where's the hole?

- [79:39–79:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I can do it.

- [79:40–79:41]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Well, I think the-

- [79:41–79:42]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  When is the hardest?

- [79:42–79:46]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah, I think it's one or three.

- [79:46–79:47]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [79:47–79:52]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'll do three also.

- [79:52–79:55]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  In that case, I didn't jump and I can help with one.

- [79:55–79:56]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [79:56–79:57]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  One?

- [79:57–79:58]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Or one?

- [79:58–79:59]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  One.

- [79:59–80:00]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  One.

- [80:00–80:02]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And you name it again.

- [80:02–80:03]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Don.

- [80:03–80:04]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Don, sorry.

- [80:04–80:05]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Excellent.

- [80:05–80:06]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  And then-

- [80:06–80:10]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  John, B, three.

- [80:10–80:11]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Good.

- [80:11–80:18]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  I'm sorry, but why are you-

- [80:18–80:19]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Okay.

- [80:19–80:20]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:20–80:21]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Toilet.

- [80:21–80:22]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:22–80:23]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:23–80:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:24–80:25]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:25–80:26]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:26–80:27]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:27–80:28]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:28–80:29]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:29–80:30]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:30–80:31]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:31–80:32]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:32–80:33]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:33–80:34]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:34–80:35]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:35–80:36]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:36–80:37]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:37–80:38]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Oh, is it?

- [80:38–80:39]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  Yeah.

- [80:39–80:40]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  All right.

- [80:40–80:41]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [80:41–80:42]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  Okay.

- [80:42–80:45]  
  _Confidence: High_  
  The other thing for people today is that we do have that-

  So he's El Presidente, time tech, she's posting because while it gets easier to
  manage through

- [81:17–81:22]  
  _Confidence: Low_  
  roads than assigning alternatives to people-

- [81:22–81:24]  
  _Confidence: Medium_  
  She's close to people basically.

- [81:24–81:26]
