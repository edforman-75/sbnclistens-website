        <h1>SBNC Website Interview Guide</h1>
        <p><strong>Workshop Pre-Work: Your Guide to Great Conversations</strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>Welcome! You're helping prepare for the November 18th workshop where we'll tackle SBNC website issues.</p>

    <p><strong>The goal:</strong> Fix 7-8 critical pages before end of term.</p>

    <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Have 2-3 casual 15-minute conversations with people who've used the website.</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>⚠️ FIRST STEP: Check the Interview Tracking List!</h3>
        <p><strong>Before you start finding people to interview:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Check who's already being interviewed:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJaoHTKC3GE2YDyUaihDQc5By6OfpLnHk4pLScbllSU/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1738229324#gid=1738229324" target="_blank">View Tracking List</a></li>
            <li><strong>Register the people you plan to interview:</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeOpZGSHKjko7SlaPAvGa3akEewIyiajXZpUMwgLSrmXFntg/viewform" target="_blank">Register Your Interviewees</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> We want to avoid contacting the same people multiple times. By checking first and registering your interviewees, we spread our interviews across more members and get better diversity of perspectives!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who Makes a Good Interviewee?</h2>
    <p>Anyone who's interacted with the SBNC website! More variety = better:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Someone considering joining</li>
        <li>Recent members (joined last 6-12 months)</li>
        <li>Active current members</li>
        <li><strong>Inactive current members</strong> (VERY VALUABLE!)</li>
        <li>Former members</li>
        <li>Mix of ages</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>CRITICAL: Seek Beyond the Super-Engaged!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ People who joined but aren't very active - Why not?</li>
            <li>✅ People who attended once and didn't return - What happened?</li>
            <li>✅ People who browse website but rarely attend - What's the barrier?</li>
            <li>✅ Former members who let membership lapse - Why?</li>
            <li>✅ People who considered joining but didn't - What stopped them?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Highly engaged members figured out workarounds. People who struggled tell us what needs fixing!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Interviews Instead of a Survey?</h2>
    <p><strong>What Surveys Tell Us:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Surface-level opinions ("The website is confusing")</li>
        <li>What people can articulate in writing</li>
        <li>Answers to questions WE think are important</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What Interviews Reveal:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What people actually do</li>
        <li>The "why" behind frustrations</li>
        <li>Things they don't realize are important</li>
        <li>Emotional reactions</li>
        <li>Stories that reveal patterns</li>
        <li>Ability to dig deeper: "Tell me more..."</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Real Example:</h3>
        <p><strong>Survey:</strong> "The events calendar is hard to use."</p>
        <p><strong>Interview:</strong> "Well, I was trying to find tennis events... I clicked on 'Activities' but that showed everything. Then I tried the calendar but I couldn't filter by sport. So I gave up and just looked at the monthly newsletter instead."</p>
        <p>See the difference? The interview reveals exactly what to fix!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The 3 Big Ideas Behind Great Interviews</h2>
    <h3>1. LISTEN WAY MORE THAN YOU TALK</h3>
    <p>Aim for 80/20: they talk 80%, you talk 20%.</p>

    <h3>2. BE GENUINELY CURIOUS</h3>
    <p>You're not interrogating. You're a curious friend trying to understand.</p>

    <h3>3. MAKE IT SAFE TO BE HONEST</h3>
    <p>People worry about hurting feelings. Encourage honesty!</p>

    <h2>The Interview Structure (15 minutes)</h2>

    <h3>INTRO (1 minute)</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "Thank you for speaking with me. I'm researching the SBNC website experience. No right/wrong answers. Your honest feedback helps us improve.
        <br><br>
        <strong>I'd like to record this conversation so we can transcribe and review it accurately. The recording will only be used by our team. Your name won't be attached to quotes. And if you'd prefer complete anonymity, just let me know. Is it okay if I record?</strong>
        <br><br>
        [Get clear YES, then START RECORDING]
