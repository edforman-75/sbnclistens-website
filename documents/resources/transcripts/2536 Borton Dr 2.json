  "text": "Yeah, do I recall that you did like a major landscaping project? Yes. Yeah. I remember talking to Larry about that a long time ago. Yeah. And that was, that was a great project, like they tore up the entire backyard and the first thing we did was put in drains. Got it. Got it. Yeah. Yeah, we did similar, and this is the first time our new landscaping has had the exposure to a really severe rainstorm, and so far it's doing pretty well. We're losing a little bit of ground cover stuff to the street, but not too much. Oh. I haven't been to your house, I don't know. Oh, we'll have to get you over here one of these days. We're on the Mesa right near the Douglas Preserve. Oh, nice. Okay. And we like totally, totally, totally redid the house. Oh, I'd love to see it. Yeah. And if you have good contractors, I'd love to... We do. We have a really, really, really good contractor, so we'll get you over here sometime soon. Oh, I would love to see. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to see this next week. My friend in L.A. helping him with his new house, and we have a request. We have the permits in right now. We're going through the permitting process to do a little bit more work, and so once we get the go-ahead, we have a few projects running. Yeah. Paul Cuellar, who we work with, was just really, really excellent, and we had a broad scope project, and he just did a really, really good job landing the whole thing. And of course, we were, I like to say, we were really very good clients in that we always the materials here when he needed them, and we always paid, and all that stuff. Yeah. I think that the biggest thing that makes jobs go awry is when the materials aren't there, and then the crew has to go off and find a different job to work on, and then it's hard to get them back, and all those kinds of things. Yeah. I've been in situations like that a lot, and I understand exactly what you're saying. Yeah. And also, like, if you're making changes, or if you, whatever. Yeah. Hey, one big question before we move into the core of the interview, there's a suggestion the other day by one of the people on the membership committee that had to do with a a realtor who had contacted him saying, hey, I want to gift a membership to Santa Barbara newcomers, to these people who just closed on a property, to my clients who just closed on a property. And it got me thinking as to whether, you know, that's the kind of thing we should market. I mean, do you think something like that would be of interest, or that's just an edge case? It was my idea when I was president, and before I was president, when I was in charge of marketing. And I tried to get it going at the time, and people, when they heard about it, they were all enthusiastic. And I did it myself. I don't know who, you know, Lita and Bill's is fine, but I sold them their house and bought them their membership. So I'm all in. I think that's one of the best ideas going, and if there were a better way to market that, I think it's well worth it. Oh, good. Good. Yeah. You know, it's something that, I mean, I know how to implement it, you know, if it comes out as being a priority that people want to implement. It really wouldn't take very long. And, I mean, part of the idea I have is just to create something that's a really kind of nice card that we could pass around among realtors that's about newcomers, and then just have an easy way to go online and actually buy a gift membership and just write a code on the card and give it to, you know, give it to your client. And suddenly your client, you know, is in. I think that's a great idea. And I think also you could even just create a tab on the website for realtors. Yeah, we'll have that too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I realize that. It's just that, and I don't know how important this is. A part of the idea was that the person suggested said that, well, the realtor may want to have like a physical card or something to hand to their client as opposed to doing it all digitally. Yeah. So here's kind of what we're up to. So Steve Denton, who's president now, decided that it would be worthwhile to do, you know, some projects to kind of renovate and upgrade our digital services and presence. We're not in a position because of the six month terms to really do anything heroic, but we can take on, you know, a number of small projects and we've already identified the next VP of technology who's quite interested in this too. But the question is, you know, what are the most important things to invest in improving or adding or whatever? So I guess what I'd like you to reflect on is what do you think are the strongest aspects of what newcomers does digitally? And what are the areas in which, you know, we could improve what we do? So is this facing membership or just facing the public? Because I think those are two separate things. It's facing everyone and feel free to talk to each one of them perhaps in sequence. Okay. So I'm going to talk about when you just log in, I'm not a member. We made some improvements to the website and the landing pages. Johnny worked on that when I was president because there were like the landing page didn't really take you anywhere that gave you any information and told you about the club. And so we made it a little bit more welcoming in that regard. And also the information that's available on the calendar. Hold on a second. And but that being said, I just find it to be really drab. The photography is boring. The fonts are boring. The colors are boring. I don't think it reflects the upscale nature of our club. Mm-hmm. Very ordinary and dated. And so somebody with a good graphic design, I could really beef it up and have more photography and maybe testimonials and things because this is how we should be getting new members. Yeah, I, you know, I I'm not supposed to in an interview like this to agree with you. But uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And. I got a complaint a few years ago and with the nature of the six-month thing, things don't really change. But I'll just, it's my community. So I'll say that's what that is something that is the low-hanging fruit here. Yeah. And as you kind of turn your attention and think about members or what the overall, I'd call it the digital offering of the club should be, you know, kind of what are your thoughts, you know, from perspective of an officer or committee chairperson, you know, a newcomer or newbie member or someone considering joining the club. What should the club be doing digitally? Well, there's, are you talking about, well, it's a combination of the social media, the website and the social media. So is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Although I'm more talking about the website and I'm trying to be open-ended because, you know, what I'm really kind of asking is, should the club basically, our services basically are, we provide events and we manage events and so on and so forth. So my point of view was, and it never really got anywhere, but what I wanted to see was some kind of a forum, a platform, which I had always suggested would be Facebook because that was my experience in Facebook with my small town that I moved from in Connecticut. There was a group called Moms in Weston. I wouldn't call it that, you know, but you would write on there, I need a new doctor. Who would you recommend? I need a plumber. And the next thing you know, you'd get like 20 recommendations from people you could actually vet. It wasn't like going on Nextdoor. It was your friends and newcomers, or in that case, our town. And so I, if, I don't know how we could work that if it wasn't in, you know, creating something out of nothing with, you know, Facebook offers groups like that. But if there were some closed forum that was like that would be a huge help to current, to members and, and maybe open-ended so that even alums can still participate and, and because alums will have the information and want to be helpful to future newcomers. You mentioned to me the other day, another idea that, that you had had about, you know, sort of like services available around, around, around town, the kinds of things that someone just moving to this area. Somebody mentioned to me, I wish that there was even a member event where they, or part of new member orientation that would include how to get your driver's license. How do I find a new doctor? Where do I register to vote? I mean, any kind of number of things like that, that when you first move here, you have no idea how to do things. And so I thought that was a great idea. Larry and I just signed up in the last couple of years for Medicare and there was this great insurance company in town that deals only in medical insurance and specifically like very helpful with Medicare. And they would be willing to do a seminar on that. So I think that if there were a way to host some of this information that are, you know, government sites, not necessarily promoting somebody's individual business, but things that are really helpful tools when you move here would be great. Yeah. Kind of the newcomer's guide to Santa Barbara. Yes. That would be interesting. And it could include, when we first moved here, you could only get cable vision or something. And now we have Frontier and people want to know, oh, you just signed up for Frontier because it's new to our neighborhood. How do you like it? What's going on? What's your service like? These are really hard to kind of nail this down when you're brand new without getting good advice. Yeah. And to think of another thing, like one of the local holidays and festivals here, like a fiesta, you know, it would be great. A calendar of annual events. Of annual events. Right. OK, those are very, very good ideas. I know that you chaired committees along the way also, and certainly were close to committee chairs. No, I was. Yeah. And I was a chair of Snooker Sports. And what else was I? Yeah. So tell me about the committee chair experience and, you know, that kind of set of services and, you know, what's good, what's bad, what's whatever. I mean, once you learn how to use Wild Apricot and go into the back end of it as a chair and you want to reach out to your committees and things, I think that's, that works pretty well. I wish that there was a way, I'm much better off texting sometimes than emailing, and I hate reply all. So whenever I'm doing an event, I try to set up like some kind of a smaller group text just for that particular event. And, oh, this is one thing, on your phone, on the app, I wish there was a way to just either press the email address of a person or press the phone number of a person and have it go through. Instead, I find myself having to copy it or add it as a contact and write down the phone number and type it back in again, or you can't copy and paste or hyperlink from the app. Okay. So, yeah, so I've pretty much hit my, you know, my questions, but is there anything else you'd like to have? Just so you know, this all ends up being anonymous, and we're going to take lots of interviews and kind of mush them together, you know, in an interesting way to come up with some insights. Well, what is a real, I'll just ask you, like, what is realistic in terms of what can be improved? So I'm not going to like throw things out there that are just kind of... Here's the range of things. It's recently expanded because recently I've figured out, and my successor, who's a woman named Doyle Ranavas, who's a truly technical person, we know how to use the API. And what that means is we can do anything we want built upon Wild Apricot's data. I mean, to give you an example, the thing I've been building, I'm very excited about, is I've actually have something that extracts the data from Wild Apricot every night and it ends up being a chatbot where you can type in a question about events or membership or which members attended the most events in the last quarter or any of that kind of stuff and actually get an answer. And we're beyond all that downloading stuff and spreadsheet wizardry and all those things. So that's just an example of what can be done. But we can do a whole lot. You're fading. I'm having trouble hearing you. Oh, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? Yeah. What I'm saying is we can do a whole lot because we can now use the API and that means we're not limited by Wild Apricot's structure or page structure or page generation system. We can go beyond their gadgets. We can incorporate our own calendar if that's what we want to do. We can incorporate a chatbot if that's what we want to do. We literally can do anything. We're not bound by Wild Apricot anymore. That said, it takes a lot more work as a volunteer organization with a very small overhead budget. We need to stay within a relatively modest and incremental range because there's not a lot of spend. Yeah. I guess a question I'd ask. So if you could reinvent Santa Barbara Newcomers Club on the web, just give me a paragraph or two. What would it be? Well, I think that it would have to be something, first of all, more trendy and upscale looking to kind of reflect the membership. More pictures of, more gallery type photos that live online. Like right now, our gallery is just attached to the Instagram. I was just looking at this on my computer app. More in-depth information about past events. Something to make the club look very exciting. And then more resources that are available. Quick links to events and maybe things to do around town. And maybe things to do that are free around town. That are open to everybody. I'm trying to think what else. I'm just poking around now because I haven't looked at the website in a while. It's just very stale and old-fashioned compared to anything. And too many words and not enough bullet points. I'll tell you what are my bugaboos. Just in order to test things, I'm very often going in and creating new fake members. And it really is hard to find the button that allows you to begin a membership application. It's there, but it's not that obvious. You have to dig through a little bit. That's one of the things that really surprised me. If I were on the website and not logged in, I don't know how you... Let me go to a different browser. Now I'm logged in. Okay, so... That's funny. It used to come up... I don't see the logo on the website anymore. Yeah, I think it's disappeared. I actually should take a look. How did that happen? Not through me. It's always... I don't see the logo when I... So that was one of my complaints when I started. You know, I'm frankly sitting on the homepage... I don't love the logo, but where is it? Yeah, I'm sitting on the homepage not logged in. And, you know, when I think about all of the wonderful pictures you've taken over time, and then I look at that About Us page... You know, it's such a blah page. Ed, I don't hear you. I was saying that the picture on the top of the About Us page is such a blah picture. It's terrible. It's just terrible. I mean, I think of all the wonderful things you've put into the archive. So anyways, hey, I really appreciate your time today. If you have any other ideas... I have more opinions, but... So just tell me, if I'm not logged in, how do I become a member? Where do I find out about becoming a member? You click on... Is it FAQs? No, there's a Join Us there somewhere. Look up at the top of the page in the upper right. I never noticed it, but there's a Join Us button. Nope. What? It says, About Events, Why Newcomers, Committees, Gallery, GA4-Test. Yeah, I gotta get rid of that GA4. I realized that I was doing a test. Join Us, Join Us, Join Us. There it is. It is there, but look where it takes you. It takes you to a... It doesn't tell you anything about us. It... Yes, I agree. You know, that's not a very friendly... No, but... Yeah. Anyway, I think that that's one of the... Speaking for myself, I think that's one of the workflows we need to work on. You know, the issue is getting people... Yeah, I mean, even like the background doesn't have to be white, and the font doesn't have to be black, and it's just... And these weird colors, pastel colors, it's just not... Yeah, those aren't... It's not cohesive. Nothing that's screaming Santa Barbara. Yeah, I was gonna say that purple is not a Santa Barbara color. No. It should be like very Mediterranean, kind of. Correct. We're sort of more on the earth tone end of the spectrum. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't want to take much more of your time, because you've been incredibly helpful. Okay. I mean, I am willing to... I'm willing to chime in a little bit more as needed. Just let me know. Okay, and if Larry is interested in chatting, have him give me a call. Oh, I don't think he has any opinions on this, really. Okay, that's fine. He's... It's not his thing. I understand. Okay, thanks. Bye-bye now. Okay, bye, Santa Jim.",
