  "text": "So this is Steve Denton and I'm recording this memo as I navigate the mobile rendering of the Santa Barbara Newcomers website. So what's interesting about it is like when you go to the landing page, you go to About Us, right? That's the landing page. Optically, it's not very pleasing, but this is where people land and this is where we need to actually be more dynamic in describing the club. We talk about the events. We talk about social integration, diverse demographics, and then candidly, we got to rationalize some of the numbers. On some pages, we say we have 700 members. On some pages, we say we have 750 members, so we got to rationalize that. But this homepage here just needs a lot of work. To me, this is the page that we've got to make visually more pleasing, a better call to action, and candidly, right here on this page, there should be a Join Us button. But the buttons are Activities, FAQs, and Learn More. So I can navigate through that. I'm sorry, there is a Join Us button at the top. We should actually put that Join Us button at the bottom after people read about us. Then maybe they want to join us because I've kind of forgot that thing was even at the top. So then if I go into the Learn More section, and it's saying, have you joined the Newcomers Club recently? Are you interested in finding out more about our club? So what's interesting about this is we're mixing messages. So we should bifurcate the experience. One should be your prospect. So we shouldn't be asking them if they've joined recently. This page, we should split it, or at least this section, we should split it up. So we reference here that we've got 700 members and over 80 events every month. We actually don't. We got 680 members, and we do about 70 events every month. And then we talk a little bit about orientation meetings there, which is fine. But if you're not a member, it's going back and forth. I would just want to rewrite the content on this entire page. When you go to the activities, this is literally a listing of our committees. So it's not really activities. These are the committees. And we talk about 20s and 40s, and we say, hey, if you're working, this is where you should join. And they have four to eight events every month. They actually don't. So again, we need to update these committees with what actually is going on and rewrite these and add some of the committees that are new, or at least make sure that they're all in here. I think they all are. But again, I would recommend that on this page, we also have a Join Us button if someone has navigated to the committees. But again, a lot of our members navigate to these committees. So the other thing that would be interesting here is if someone's using the website, I don't want to put their name. So it would be good if you clicked on Afternoon Book Club there and you went into what that was. And at the same time, you could email that committee chair right here from the Activities Committees page on the website. FAQs, is Santa Barbara newcomers a good fit for me? We talk about who's eligible to join, how much it costs, how many people in the club, what if I work? I think this would be a page like fixing the FAQs and fixing the Learn More About Us and just those first four pages that someone navigates to when they join the club, that's where we convert them. When we go to the calendars, when I look in the calendar here, I don't see where any of the waitlisted events are actually showing up right now in the mobile app, where they do show up on the web app. So on the mobile rendition, I don't see, and I'm looking at it right now, I know the President's Party is waitlisted, but that's still showing up blue. And maybe there's a way to cut that in half. And then this is where we could get really smart around registration codes and where we get really smart around making it easier to register for an event on the website. Because if I want to register for an event on the website, I'm probably going to be doing that. Like, hey, if you look at the bottom here, it says, don't see what you're looking for, log in. If you're not a member yet, join us. If you're an alumni, contact alumni liaison. That's cool. It might be interesting there to say, are you an alumni? Click here for events that you can attend. And it would just list the events that the alumni could attend or a non-member. That would make a lot of sense to me. And then as you work through this thing, why newcomers, again, it's just a repeat about why you should join. It seems we got upcoming public events here. That's a great place. This could actually also be surfaced up for alumni member exclusive events. This would be a great way to target or focus on events that are actually, well, focusing on the events that are actually going to drive a lot of attendees there. Or promote events, you got committees and you got the gallery and you got contact us. But when I go through the website, visually, it's not pleasing. But more importantly, I've got to click into a lot of different things to get information. I get repeated information in different areas and it's not consistent. So let's think a lot about those first four pages that prospective members are going to visit. And let's think about the four pages that members who don't use wild apricot are going to visit. And that's where I think we can have huge impact on there. Thanks so much.",
