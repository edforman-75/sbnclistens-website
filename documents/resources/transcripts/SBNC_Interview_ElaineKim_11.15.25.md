## Full Transcript

Hello, I'm here with Elaine Kim. Thank you so much for joining us. I am an idiot and totally did not record our first version. Elaine is so, I'm just having a crazy week, but Elaine is so nice to now do a short recap of the interview we just did, which I did not capture. So thank you so much, Elaine. To recap the first question, I think you had shared just actually how easy the website was for when you first became a member or were interested in becoming a member in respects to the calendar view. I'll just recap this and then I'll let you recap your feedback for the website itself. Elaine had shared that the events tab, the calendar was really helpful when she was interested in becoming a member because she was easily able to see that there was a TGIF event, that it was in her neighborhood. And so that seemed like it was a good, good flow. The information was there when you wanted it. And then let's just go through, because I think you had some really good feedback about each one of the tabs kind of at a high level. So we're going to start with the about us page, which is the landing page. So looking at that first page, just kind of general thoughts and feedback and possible improvements. Yeah. So I'm not going to repeat everything I said, because I might've gotten too much into the nitty gritty, but in terms of the big picture stuff, I only really care about like when I go to the site, I want to, when I'm first going, I look at the about thing just to see, you know, what the goal of the organization is. It was really clear to me, you know, you want to meet people in the community. I think there's a lot of verbiage that I'm probably not going to read on the page. And for whatever reason, when I first went, I was not aware of the 20 to 40 somethings committee. So, but, but the info is here. I just didn't see it. But it's clear that this is the thing to meet new people. And then I go to the events thing and really the events tab is all that I use. I go to that link and that's, that's the only thing I use on the website. And I typically the events calendar view, just because it has it laid out in a way where I can, you know, see it the month at a glance and see the various see more than I can with the list view, which only covers, it looks like a few days. I think it would be helpful to know which events still have openings or have it blocked out or something like that. If it's no longer open for signing up, just because sometimes I'll see something that's interesting, but when I go into it, it's like most things actually that I'm interested in, I'll go in and then it says, Oh, you have to be on the wait list. And then I'm not really a wait list type. So I did wait list the other day for the, the marsh tour in Carpinteria, just because I really wanted to see the marsh. But for the most part, if I see wait list, wait list, wait list for every single thing I'm interested in, then I kind of stop looking at the website too. I think that's really good feedback. You had also shared feedback about that it might be nice, or you would appreciate if there was an easy way to cancel if you could no longer make it. Yeah, yes. Because I think that creates extra, like, it sucks up more time for it causes more work for everybody. Because sometimes like I just want to hit cancel if it turns out I can't make something which happened on the hike today because it was raining. Yeah. But instead, I have to like figure out, okay, you know, who's organized this event, I wasn't able to figure out who organized the event, but I did like find an email and I reached out and I told them, but then that causes them to have to do work in order to, you know, and I just mean, it might be easier for the organizers as well, if they could just easily have a cancellation button. Yeah, win win, for sure. I think that's really good feedback. And then on the next tab, the why newcomers tab where it says, kind of a recap of about us and why join think that you would have some thoughts on this page as well. I mean, I guess, I think it's best if like, so the top I just don't go to the page. Yeah, it's not it just doesn't really serve much purpose for me. Because I already know like about us would typically be categorized under the about tab. And then why join? I'm not sure we really need to like sell people on this proposition, because we already know we want to join because we want to meet people. But you know, it doesn't really matter to me. It's not like this tab bothers me. Because I just not going to go to it. Right. It's almost like they have the external facing for potential members. Still, they have a lot of tabs that are still there, even for the current members once they sign in. It's like kind of a fusion of putting things for potential members, even when you sign is and as a member, I'm just noticing. Yeah, but also, let me see. And then what else does it have on this page? Upcoming public events, member exclusive events. I mean, anyways, it doesn't really matter to me, but I don't go to this tab. Yeah. So I don't go to any of the rest of them. Yeah. And then committees tab. Yeah, I don't go in. I did go in the committees tab once when you were having that event, you know, where you can go and sign up for a committee. So then I went to that because I wanted to see what else was. Yeah, what committees were available? Yeah. And then. Yeah, I think we had talked about the radio buttons on this page, like if this is for committees like these kind of photos could go in the gallery and that because the reason I mentioned that is because the heading, the activity committees takes up, it's a huge bar that takes up a lot of space and then the photo takes up so much space. So an entire screen is kind of taken hostage by this stuff so that you would essentially have to go down, scroll all the way down in order to find what you're here for, which is the names of the committees. But once you get to the actual committees list, it's super helpful because like the info I need is right here. The description is not too long. And I like that. Yeah. Nice. And so now again, I'm looking at the signed in view as well. It looks like the directories tab is the next one. I mean, yeah, I think we had talked about like for me, I guess not that I'm designing the website. It might be helpful to think about the hierarchy and how we categorize things because there's only two items in the hamburger menu and then there's seven top tier like top list items, which is a lot, but it doesn't matter to me. Again, I only go to eBets. That's the only one I use. Yes. I think that makes total sense. Last but not least, we had that gallery tab that had the prompt to follow newcomers on Instagram with that kind of gallery. Any last thoughts on that page? Not really. I think I like the way I'm seeing it here. Some of the squares are kind of like there's nothing in them, but that's okay. I mean, I don't go to this tab either. Yeah. Gotcha. Perfect. Was there anything else that you had shared in version one? I mean, I was rambling a lot and I don't think the stuff I said was ultimately that important. Do you think something was important that you want to include? Then, you know, I'm happy to include it. It was just me rambling, really. Perfect. No, that sounds like a good idea. I mean, I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. I think that's a good idea. It was just me rambling, really. Perfect. No, that sounds good. I think we got the good stuff. Top lining again, I hear you say having an ability for the 20s and 40s, some way to know that that exists, especially for that demographic that's a small but noticeable part of the club. Being able to see when events are already full and wait-listed, and then also having that ability to just more seamlessly cancel. Looking at the hierarchy of sites, knowing why people come to this when they're members. Like you said, I think you're not alone that a lot of members really just look at the calendar and events view and not a lot of other stuff. Yeah. It's all about how can that events page be as helpful as possible. I think it would be helpful if every single item that I'm clicking into doesn't wind up leading me to a wait list. Yeah, totally. Then like you said, the hamburger menu, having all of those tabs across and then two additional tabs in the hamburger menu, to me it seems like a lot. I think your point- I'm not saying it's too extra. I was just making a side comment that usually some of the other stuff can go in the hamburger menu. That way it makes it more minimal. Totally, because you could then use it. What its function is for is to be able to make the website more streamlined, so then you can hide things. Yeah, that makes sense. Right, exactly. Because right now there's tabs all over the place. There's the whole activities, events, and facts buttons below as well. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you so much, Elaine. Thanks for doing this twice. Yeah, sure. Double thank you for you. Have a lovely evening. Thanks again. Okay, bye. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.
