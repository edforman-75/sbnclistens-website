  "text": "All righty. So Kieran, thank you so much for doing this interview. Oh, it's absolutely my pleasure. Yay. So how did you originally hear about Santa Barbara newcomers? I heard about Santa Barbara newcomers through one of the board members who helped bring me here to Santa Barbara, who had been a previous member of newcomers. And we looked into it, and then I believe my wife heard about it separately than me, and we both discussed it, and it seemed like a great opportunity to get to know new people here in the Santa Barbara area as we were new ourselves. And then talk to us about what the process was for joining. Was there anything confusing when you were trying to join as a member? To be very honest, I don't remember the process for joining. I think it was pretty simple. I don't believe it was confusing. I think there's an overwhelming amount of clubs and groups to join, and I think selecting which ones you're going to participate in is a little daunting, but I don't remember it being complex to get in. Okay. And then, so Kieran is an alumni of under a year is when he had timed out, and I just gave him a refresher of the website, which he had used a while back. So just tell me about your impressions of the website after seeing it. It feels very dated. The website appears very dated. When I first looked at it, not having a header at the top saying that it was the Santa Barbara newcomers, you could mistake it for another website here in Santa Barbara. It felt confusing looking at it, not knowing where to go. Once again, the dated aspect of it, I think the color scheme is not very inviting or exciting either way. You're using basic font, using bold to highlight. I think you could be using much newer or more innovative ways to get people's attention. Like I said, it looks like something that was kind of put together, and I don't want to offend anyone, whoever may be listening to this, but it looks like something that was very simply put together and not intended to be drawing individuals into something, but maybe just for an FYI or informational purpose. I also don't think that it's good to have your member exclusive events and then have a listing of things that are canceled. So it just looks like a lot of information, and I think people are going to see it. They're going to kind of glaze over it and maybe not go deep into where you want them to go. It's also not very driving. It's not driving them to where you want them to be. The other piece of it is there's a lot of clubs and a lot of different committees. And also on the activities committee page, you have what is a scrolling across header or banner. That is way too big. You have way too many things going. No one's going to be on that page long enough to see all of those things. So you need to pick or focus on a few things that you really want to highlight. Great, Karen. Thank you for that feedback. My next question is, when you were a member, what did you typically use the website for? Did you use it? I never once used the website. I used the app. That was what I used in order to identify events or to register for events or to either check in or see what I was invited to. So I didn't use the website at all. Did you originally use it maybe when you were told to, the recommendation to join as a member? Do you think you took a look back then? I think I took a look maybe once or twice when I was going through the registration process and the joining process and never went back. Gotcha. And what information were you looking for when you were considering joining, if anything? I know it was a personal recommendation, but I'm curious if there's anything outside of that that you were looking for that would have enticed you. I was looking for some committees that I had an interest in or that I had a shared interest in. I did feel a little bit overwhelmed by the committees, but I did find a few that I had some shared interest in. But that was really the main use of the website that I had. So now looking specifically now at the homepage, is there any other feedback or impressions, things that you would recommend? For context, Kieran is a business leader locally that heads up a very large healthcare organization based in Santa Barbara, so he works closely with his marketing department. So grain of salt, but if you have any impressions or recommendations, let us know. Well, I think on your events page, having a calendar would be very, very helpful. And having that calendar actually be more engaging and reflecting the actual events, maybe with some visuals on the calendar, it just doesn't seem inviting to me. And I'm just wondering how you can make that more inviting. Also, you have to click through a few different buttons to get to the calendar. It might be nice if it showed up as a thumbtail on the original events page that people can then click into that thumbtail to get more information. And what about the homepage? It looks like the homepage itself is the about page. The homepage looks like you're starting either a surfing club or a lifeguarding club. I think you need to be way more specific or have pictures showing the events that you're doing, have pictures showing the Santa Barbara newcomers sign or the logo. It could be a homepage for any club. The only thing that identifies it is that first line in the paragraph. Yeah. And then the next page here on the homepage is why newcomers? Do you have any thoughts about this or feedback or recommendation? Too many words. It's way too much detail. I think when you have a why newcomers, you need to shorten that up and then make it pop in both areas. Why about us? Why join? Shorten it up. Make it pop. Use keywords and see if you can do more with less. I think you're trying to do a lot with a lot right now. Yeah. And similarly, I think you had spoken to your feedback on the activity committees page where there's a lot of tiles. Way too many revolving tiles. You're never going to make it through all of those. And then there's got to be a better way to highlight your committees. I know that you need to have quite a few of them because you have such a diverse community, but how you highlight those, there may be another way that you haven't looked at yet. Yes. Thank you. The last page besides the contact us, let's take a look at that. That looks pretty standard, but do you have any input or feedback on the contact page as well as any ideas of how to improve it? Just doesn't look inviting. Again, it's got the same kind of blandness that the website has. So I would just spice it up a little bit. And specifically when you say to make it more inviting, what would be an example of that? You know, I think that you need to come up with that and maybe test it or test it with a focus group or trial audience. But I can say that the way it looks right now with just a white background, with the white text boxes, the black font, it's just not very inviting. Gotcha. And then the last tile here besides the contact us looks like a link to our Instagram page with recent posts. Any input or feedback on this page? I just think it makes you look very small. I think some of the pictures are blank. Some of them are just boxes. It's a link to your Facebook, but when you post something from Facebook, you need to find a way to get the page actually showing the picture on your webpage. Yeah. I think what Kieran is seeing is some of these tiles are video slideshows of pictures or videos themselves. And so when they populate on this page, some of them are blank or blurry because they haven't come into focus yet. But food for thought. I'm going to click on this last button that says join us because we didn't see this before. This looks like just some info. I think your feedback probably still stands, but if there's anything else. Feedback still stands and it shows level newbie newcomer. Do you have other levels? Because if you have, you would list them here. But if you don't, then you wouldn't call it a level. That's just the first. That's the first and only area that you can join. That is true. Newbie is a default, not a choice in this case. So I could see how that would be confusing. Unless you're bringing alumni's back and in which case you would have a level two alumni member. Right. It would be information associated with a choice, not just information. Great. Let me just take a look here and see if there's anything else. Is there anything else about the website that frustrates you or that you wish had worked better during your time as a newcomer? I haven't looked at it from a mobile standpoint. So you'll just want to make sure that it's mobile friendly. And also with your, there is a, I know in healthcare there's a regulation with the website that it needs to have a translation aspect to it. I don't know if the website has a translation aspect to it either. You mean part of the accessibility laws? Yeah. Yeah. That absolutely is something that we would have to do or make sure is in place if it's not already. Great. Well, thank you so much, Kieran. We appreciate your time and your input and thanks again. You're very welcome. And thank you for listening. Thank you, Santa Barbara newcomers. And if you ever decide to allow more years or to have your alumni come back in, we'll look forward to getting an email or getting an invitation back. Thank you. Great. ",
