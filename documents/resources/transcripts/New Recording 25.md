from the newbie newcomer dinner have at it good I didn't want to be first that's the other thing I was going to say I didn't want to be first but if you insist long story for me to get here it involves the love of my life and a long hiatus but we're back together for 10 years now yeah it's an incredible story but I've told it so many times already you'll have to buy the book have you used the website you any about the website it's way more than I need but it's very easy to use for a person that's not really a computer person okay and and yes I'm very happy to have it every event that we've been to has been absolutely fabulous and like I say again easy to get to okay great because of the website which way is that okay I don't know directions in Santa Barbara yeah so I'm Helen I moved here June 1st from Boston in the city and I chose Santa Barbara based on criteria that I had for what I was looking for and high on that list was community and of course this newcomers club is so perfect right and the chance to get to know what's in the area and all of the lovely parts of Santa Barbara and the unique things that just pop up and of course you know all of the people as well it's just very it's so I've lived in nine states and six years in Germany and this and this is without a doubt the friendliest place I have ever moved to so I'm very happy to be here and the website is is great the one suggestion I have is you know when you when you look at the list and it's like this is the date and stuff it might be nice to have the time reflected easily so I don't have to open it first to see what time it is and then but clearly that's a minor thing it would just be easy or yeah and I moved here from Maine and that process Brunswick Maine North Bowdoin College very good I'm a New Englander lifelong my whole family is there one of six kids they're all there so what caused me to move here my younger son went to UCSB 18 years ago which started this my other son moved out you know now here I am and I now have a two-week-old grandson so that makes it absolutely special what's his name his name is Baker it's a family name and he's a cutie pie of course all of you grandparents here so been here seven weeks so I'm a newbie appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight and the website yeah the one thing I I'm very impressed with the organization it's incredible the one thing that would be helpful to me is whenever these you know when you have the app and you get a notification and it says four new things have been launched okay then you go and you try to find them you can't find them so it would be really great to have both on the app and the website the new things are highlighted in some fashion maybe they're up at the top of the list and I don't know how you would do it maybe they're a different color you know whatever but that's you can't find them and that's you just took my just been no they may not even be open yet they've just been announced so and the registration is in a week or two so it's good to know what is new because now you have to go all the way back through the whole list to see what might be new so anyway that's just my idea yeah my name is Linda I'm from moved here from Reading about a little over a year ago because my children are here so that's that's why many of us are here yeah I'm a co-chair so I have a couple of little things that were have been difficult for me one is if I've never done a jot form my partner does that and she had a lot of trouble with it so I don't know if there's a way to make that easier and the other thing is if someone cancels and you go to the waitlist then the person who cancels theoretically gets a refund and the new person pays and that was extremely time-consuming and then I did it wrong and Charlie who was Charlie she's a bookkeeper yeah she texted me and she fixed it but and then the other thing is that I've just been thinking about this week is when you get a reminder on the email you know reminder your event is coming up it would be nice to have the address in that reminder since it's only going to the people who are registered because then I have to scramble back and figure out where it is yeah so those are the couple of things all right I'm Valerie and I moved back to Santa Barbara in February from the East Coast and I knew where I was going and that's the reason why I came here I had friends here already and I wanted to be back in Santa Barbara where I feel home because I'm originally from France originally so I lived in Boston area I live in many many places different states in this country but Santa Barbara is number one that's for sure it's a great place website and application from from day one I signed up to the newcomers again it's frustrating when you're trying to sign up to some thing so you're on your app so you have to open close your app go to your calendar and see the date of the November 9 I don't know what November is a Thursday or Saturday and it's helpful for people who are working because there is activities you cannot do obviously because it's during the day and so that will be some steps I mentioned that a while ago but nothing has changed also we're getting a lot of emails you know when we sign up the payment reminder reminder a week before reminder a couple days before plus being the treasurer I get also a lot of other emails and my email is just swamp with Santa Barbara newcomers club so I cannot even know which one when I need to go back with the address today I didn't know which one I had to look at I had to open so many so yes but uh otherwise yeah it's a great place to meet people and to do different things then you didn't even know existed in this town and so yes please have more things on the weekends yeah yeah because sometimes also when it's after working hours people thinks they do that don't start any event at five o'clock it's not after working hours is when I get off work so I cannot be there so that's yes that's a handicap to be able to sign up to some event then I definitely know I cannot make it because if I get late it's not all mine hi I'm Carl Sanken and I'm the chair of the dining-in committee along with my co-chair Lea Zisfein so we helped you get here and and you signed up for it and we distributed it you know we tried to do it we tried to do it well we tried to you know use who's a member of the group who's you know not a member of the group that sort of stuff you know we didn't put your names all in a bag and and then just drew names to see who would go but at any rate my gripe with the with the with the website is that you just got to go through so many different iterations of it to be able to get to the information that you want and even that tonight we had an example of how sometimes the website just doesn't work a friend of mine called me saying that she was lost she didn't know how to get to a certain house where she was going to go to the other dinner party tonight and we looked on the website thanks to Ed we came up with an address and it was the wrong address her registration yeah corner case her registration on the website was not correct she had moved since you registered and and there there had not been a correction so as a result we almost sent this person who was lost to the wrong address and I think that we need something to make our website more contemporary contemporary that we need to have somebody overseeing the website and who's who's not around who's moved that sort of stuff I'm just gonna make another file
