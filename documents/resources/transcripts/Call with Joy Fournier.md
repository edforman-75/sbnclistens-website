## Full Transcript

I probably won't have a lot to say because I don't have any opinions about technological things, but anyway. Yeah, so let me just start off by just saying this is Joy Fournier and the call's being recorded for the purposes of website renovation. And Joy, start with just a quick overview of how long you've been in newcomers, what your roles have been, and what your principal uses of the website have been. Oh, okay. Yeah, I started, I joined newcomers in March 2023, and I have been a chairman of the pop-up committee, and I was also on the wine appreciation committee, games committee, and theater lovers committee. Holy Jesus. Yeah, and then the main purpose I use the website is only to look for events, and then sign up for them if I can do them, if I want to do them and can do them. And that's really all I ever use the website for. Great. So what is your, what's your general impression of knowing that you use a lot of other websites, but what's your general impression of the newcomers website, both in terms of visual and functionality? I think it's very good. I don't know how it can be improved, but yeah, it seems to be, it gets the job done. You can find things easily by date, and that's all I look for. Yeah. And that's, that's the main thing you're looking for is, is dates and events and that sort of thing, as opposed to, do you ever go to any of the other directories and say, look through the governing documents or try to find any information about why things are the way they are? I think, no, not at all. But I did look once because I was trying to find someone's phone number, I think, but that was probably two years ago. So I don't remember. And to, you know, or there's some, you know, some people's email addresses or something. So I found on like the directory or something, but don't ask me how I did it because I don't remember. And that's all. Other than that, I only look at events. Yeah. Okay. So have you ever found anything that is frustrating for you on the website? In other words, something you couldn't find or something disappeared or? No, but each time I want to go back to the calendar of events after, after clicking on an event and reading about it, then I want to go back to the calendar of events. It goes back to the beginning of like many months ago. It doesn't start where I just left off. So then I have to scroll down, try to find it. It also makes me go back to clicking on list view versus the other calendar view, whatever that I think it's called calendar view. So I have to click on list view, then scroll down and go back to where I was like, say I'm mid November. So now I want to go back to mid November, but it made me go in and I'm looking at things in June and whatever. So that's the only thing that's frustrating. And then the other thing that was frustrating, but that got fixed was that it often would put the date. Like November 14th, but it doesn't say what day of the week it is. And I know people brought that up at some of the officer meetings and that was changed. So now it says Friday, November 14th, because I only as I have, I worked Monday through Friday, eight to five. So I only could do things in the evenings or weekends. So to me, it's very important. If I know if it's a Saturday or. The Monday through Friday at 10am when I can't do it kind of thing. Right, right, exactly. No, I and I know exactly what you're talking about in terms of the of the list view and then the calendar view and that sort of thing. I think that's that's the first time that's gotten mentioned. So I'm glad you mentioned it because I probably would have mentioned that as well. So are there specific other pages? I mean, I guess you've really stated that the calendar is really what you rely on. Which, which I have never really gone through. I've actually got the website up now and I'm looking at it. Yeah, I did that when I first joined, because I can't remember when I joined. There's a list of them, needless to say on the website and also a blurb about what each committee does is even pictures as a matter of fact Yes, that's right. Which, which I had never really gone through. I've actually got the website up now and I'm looking at it. But Yeah, I did that when I first joined, because I can't remember why I just thought I had to, to see what the committees are. But then, and I've kind of read each blurb and And then I just said, then I never looked again because I just started picking things by I didn't like, oh, it has to be an arts arts committee, it has to be that weekend and there's many Didn't matter. I just looked at everything on the calendar and pick things I like to do that fit in my calendar. Right. And I don't, I didn't need description of what the committees call, you know, Yeah, yeah, their description anymore. I didn't care about that anymore. Yeah. Interesting. Right. So in, in terms of what you've heard from others, have there been, has there been comments from anybody else that have said, now the website is just hard to navigate or I'm having trouble finding something or No. Any experience from anybody else? Because you've been on a lot of committees and you've, have you ever, you've done, obviously you've done job forms in the past, right? Well, I helped with a couple of them. And then my co-chairman Danette Nelson took over all the job forms when I was at, when I was a co-chair of the pop-up committee because it was too complicated, all the technology. Lucky you had somebody to take it. I know. Because the job form is a nightmare for most. And that's a whole nother world because it's, it's not just on the website. That's all in our technology area. And we're trying to deal with, deal with that as well. Exactly. How about just when you look at the website visually, is there anything that, what kind of feeling do you get when you look at it visually? Do you feel invited in? Is it, does it not matter? What, what are your thoughts? Good question. I don't know that I, Are you in front of the computer at this point or not? I can go over there, but sometimes when I do, people can't hear me because I have bad reception. Oh, okay. Forget it. I'm going to go over there anyway and try it. Not to worry. If you can't hear me, I'll, no, I'll, I'm going to, I'm going to do it right now. Okay. Bring it up because, you know, in the file, and if you can't hear me, just let me know and I'll just leave my office and go back out to the living room where people can hear me. Okay. So I'm in there. I'm going to pull it up. It is. There it is. A newcomer website. I mean, it just starts off with, I have to log in, you know, that says about us, right. About events, why newcomers committees gallery. So it's not super pretty or anything like that, but it's not bad. It's just, let me log in. Okay. I just logged in. Yeah. So, yeah, no, I don't know. I don't have any suggestions for that really. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, and I think it's, you know, it ends up being kind of personal taste and whatnot. I mean, I look at a whole lot of websites. There's some that are just, I want to get in and get out and just kind of functionality. And then there's some that, you know, really are fascinating in terms of how they, how they work. And I think we're going to, we're going to, we're going to work through that. I think the visual in, in our website website needs can, can use some small thing up a bit. I mean, I think it needs to be prettied up a little bit just to be more attractive, not just for people like me, but people who are not like me who may want something a little more, a little more inviting, but yeah, I think so. It's, it, there's, for people trying to navigate for things like policies and bylaws and governing documents and other kinds of things, it's, you need to kind of search those out. And it's not always clear where that stuff is. So, and sometimes committee chairs need to do that. So if, if there was, if somebody said, Hey, Joy, give us a couple of things or even one thing about this website that you would, you would change or make better. I think one we've already nailed down, which is having the coordination between the calendar and the list view. I frankly, I love the list view and, and it's, it is frustrating when you have to kind of five steps to get back to it. And, but anything else? How about, how about, do you, do you at all remember when you first joined and signed in and whether there was any difficulty in just getting in? No, I don't think so. Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember anything wrong with it. I just registered so long ago and it seemed like it was easy. You just paid the money and then it was there. I know, I know, I know. And point of fact, you're supposed to read, you know, the, the, the, the statements of, of requirements or bylaws in terms of conditions and the whole lot of stuff that you're supposed to read. And then you click, click, click a box. And what we're finding is most people are just clicking the box. Yeah, sure. I clicked the box. I didn't read that. It's a voluntary newcomer club. I wasn't going to read them all. I don't think so. Yeah, it's pretty good. As, as an alumni, which is unfortunately coming up soon for you. Dang, that's going to be, oh my God. And you too. Yeah, me too. I could, I, I make it through July, but. That's it. Okay. A little longer than me. Yeah, I love it. What would you, what would you hope that you would have access to as an alumni? I can't think what it would be. I know that I'll be popped out of like seeing full calendar and I'll only have to view the public events calendar. That's according to rumor. Right. And then, yeah, so it's the TJFs and other stuff like that. But I don't know. I would love to know. Yeah, if there's, will they be listing alumni events that I can click on and look for? Or how do I find out about, how will we find out about those when we graduate? Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that's something that's in the works for this discussion as well is, is there going to be a, an alumni page, if you will, that, that only alumni can get into, not just anybody off the street, but will also give you more than, you know, not as much as a full member, but enough to understand to see what might be coming up and, and how to connect with others. Because I think it's a big deal for, for us, for Steve, Steve, Steve Bennett. This point is, is how do we keep alumni in the works, you know, in the midst. Yeah, for sure. Because there is, there's no gray area right now. There's just full members and then any public view thing. Right. So if there could be an alumni, you know, button or some way to log into that in the future. Well, now, now, now we've got an alumni coordinator, as a matter of fact, Nancy Rosenthal has taken on. Oh, good. Yeah. So we're going to be thinking about what are the things to, to do anyway. Oh, great. All right. Great. I'll keep my ears open. Okay. Listen, I'm going to, I'm going to just say thank you. And, and I'm going to close off the, the, the recording. You're welcome.
