## Full Transcript

So I'm here with Lori and Ann Marie and Molly and so we're just talking about the website. So how often do you use the website? Are you talking about that app? Not actually the app, but the one that you use on your computer. Hello, welcome. So a couple times a week. Yeah? I hope that's okay. Yeah. I mean, I go on, you know, to sign up for stuff. And how does that work for you, the signing up? Um, generally it's gone pretty well. I mean, I've... Yeah, it's gone well. Have you had any problems? I have on occasion. Well, just that it wouldn't, like, it just wouldn't complete. Like when I was signing up for something, it didn't. And so then I just gave up and came back later. That's fine. Yeah, that's, I'm trying to think, you know, distinguish it from, I spend all day on my computer at work. But I also go on to it, like, I go to the, is it the directory? Is it called the directory? To look people up. Like if I'm going to go to an event and I see people who signed up and I don't recognize names, then I go and I look them up just to see what they say about themselves. Just because I like to have some idea of, gee, is anybody from Minnesota or does anybody, you know, what are they? So I use it for that too. So I use it to look at the events calendar. I use it to sign up for events. And I use it to look people up. Okay, cool, cool. And do you use the app sometimes too? No, I don't do that. Well, I mean, occasionally if I'm at my, at work on like a Friday and I decide, oh, maybe I should go to TGIF. I look it up on my phone. I mean, I get, I, but I don't think I've downloaded the app. Do you have to download the app to use it? I think so, but anyway. Oh, well, I have been able to look it up on my, the calendar. Okay. To see where TGIF is. Okay, perfect. All right, well, great. Thank you.
