We really don't have a process for enabling people to update their data. Okay, so I'm Ed Foreman. I happen to be the Vice President of Technology. But I take absolutely none of this personally. I have this love-hate relationship with wild apricot. And it's more on the hate side than the love side because it's a very old-fashioned, in terms of the way it's implemented, it's a very old-fashioned system. The things that I would like to see out of our website are, there are a few different ones. I said one, but I'm gonna go. One of them is, I just think that we as a club need to present ourselves as being fresher and more contemporary. Our website just kind of feels old. And even though I'm old, I don't want to be a member of an old person's club. The second thing, because occasionally I have to create fake members to test things, I go through the membership join workflow from time to time, and it's remarkably convoluted. I feel very, very lucky when I find that button to join. It's pretty well hidden beneath layers of information. And then, the third thing for me is, I really want a my newcomers page that just lists in one place all of the events I'm registered for as a way of keeping track. And by the way, that is there. We have this in the application. Okay, so I don't use the application. I use the website. I have a ticket on the website. Yeah, and the website doesn't make that easy to do. So it's things like that. The other thing I'll just mention to everyone is that we have a lot of control over the website. We have almost no control over the application. The application is really, really canned, and the opportunities for customization are quite limited. On the website, we've discovered new ways. I mean, we could, if we wanted to make a substantial investment, we could make the wild apricot experience go away for our users and just sort of build another website on top of it that utilizes it under the covers. So those are my comments. I'd just like to improve our public presence. I think that that's something that's relatively easy and would make me feel better. I wanna second your comments about not being able to update our information. Yes, so let me add that one. Being able to add features that would allow users with proper authentication to update their own information, because many people come here, they find some place where they wanna live for a few months, or until they find where they really wanna live, and we don't have a systemic way of making it easy to update that information. Perhaps, perhaps so. Maybe that's something we should bring up at the board meeting. We're actively involved in doing this. Yeah, but at the board meeting, to let the chair, to let people do it. It comes back to me anyway. You can do it on the app, though, right? Can't you hit the profile and then change? Yes, I do change my address on the phone. Yeah, but is it obvious how? It's possible that we should just have a thing, just a list of things you may wanna do. Why not an automated announcement that goes out to everybody? Monthly update, have you moved, changed your telephone number, gotten a divorce, changed your credit card, and stuff like that? It would be something that would be probably easy to program into the system. It would be. Go ahead. If you could reflect on the new member experience, the joining experience, that would be valuable. Okay, I'm Jamie DuPont. I just moved here from Tiburon, California a week ago, and I feel so lucky to have found this organization through a friend of mine who lives here, and I'm delighted to meet you all and to have so many opportunities in my calendar to do things and not be sitting there sort of being scared at home, feeling like, did I make the right move? This is a very comforting community, and I'm honored to be a member. My joining was easy peasy. It was like that, and I don't consider myself that tech forward, so. I do find the calendaring part clunky. It seems antiquated. You click on something, and then you wanna see what a time or what it costs or if it's sold out, and then you have to go back, and then you're back at the top of the calendar. You're not where you were in the calendar, and I'm not used to that. And so it's just more time than scroll. Where was I? And so it just takes a bit more time, I think, to manage the calendar, but I just jumped into the calendar and was looking at everything, so that might just be my purview of the website, but I did find joining to be pretty easy for me. Yeah. Well, let me give you a tip as a new newbie, for the newbies, when you see an event where it's already been sold out, newbies have priority, so always, if you wanna go get on the wait list. That's how I'm here tonight. You are most likely gonna get the spot, and you'll be going to that event, so do it. Take advantage of that, because, yes, it's a booster without knowing it. How long does newbie status last? Three months, 30 days. I still have a week or so. Okay. So do as much as you can on your first three months, because you have the opportunity to, because after that, you might be stuck with joining the wait list and not making it, so. I'm Todd. I'm from San Diego, and I'm delighted to be here tonight, and I really have nothing but good things to say. I've told some people that I'm a legacy, because my mother was a member of the Santa Barbara Newcomers in 1965. She just moved here from Edinburgh, Scotland, and she knew nobody in town. I don't think my father participated in any way. I think it was just her. I just have these mind flashes. I was very young at the time, but I'm very proud of the fact that I'm here, you know, as a kind of, you know, extension of her. I thought joining was remarkably easy. I have no complaints. In fact, I joined at like two o'clock in the afternoon, and by four, I got an email from someone saying, come to the orientation tonight. You know, it was really, really nice. Could not have been nicer. Heather's point was a good one about the, when it flashes up, there's four new things. They should be highlighted in some way, and not just that you have to kind of burrow through to find them, but aside from that, I really have no complaints. This has just been a 100% positive experience. Hi, I'm Pam. Let me jump in here just for the hell of it. I have never got an email that says four new things. It's the app. Yeah, well, as I said, I've never gotten one, never found one. It's never come to me. It's a notification from the app. It's an app notification. You'll have, you know. It's an app notification. Yeah, you have six new events every day. It's awesome. Do you use the app? If you click on it, it's not going anywhere. We have no control over that. And I've never gotten one. So that's the first thing. Okay. However, I was gonna add that maybe that what should happen is when something comes up, there should be full information about it, not just here's a thing that's coming, you'll love it. The address is, the time is, the cost is, and it should be right there when those things come up, as opposed to, you know, sign up for the tour of Joe Doak's garage or something like that. Then you have to go sign up. Yeah, and then if I could just add, thank you to the hosts. I mean, to put yourselves out here is so nice. And I know, you know, we bring food, but you have to clean up and, you know, set up and all that. So it's very nice. No, wait a minute. No, no, no. As guests, we should help the hosts clean up. We have dishwasher, right? Dishwasher, no problem. We have dog, though. Yeah. Dog, no problem. Pam, go ahead. Hi, I'm Pam. I'm originally from Santa Barbara and I moved to Philadelphia when I was 12. And I finally got back here like two and a half years ago. So good to be back home. I, about the website, I like what Jamie said about, it drives me crazy. Like when you click on something and it doesn't bring you back to that and you have to scroll down, like, where was I? And also with Valerie, I'm a working girl too. I wish, well, it's really like, not really the website, but I wish there were more events like during, like on the weekends or, you know, during the evening. Like that out to lunch group, I can't ever go because it's always during the week, you know, so. I'm on that committee. Would it help if we tried to schedule something on the weekend? Yeah. I used to be on that committee and I did, I would always do it on Saturdays. Yeah, I went to the, I was co-chair of that. Okay, well, I'm not a co-chair, but for what it's worth, we do have something coming up in January that's gonna be on Saturday or something. Oh, good. But if that's something that I can bring up to the chair. Yeah, I'm not the only one. There are some of us that are still working. Perfect, perfect. Yeah. Let me bring it up to the chair. Okay, that'd be wonderful. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm Heather and Pete and I joined in early September and we both think it's wonderful. We're just having a wonderful time and I think it's extremely well organized and well thought through. I'm realizing now there's still a few things I don't really know how they work as far as like, I've joined the book club, but I know, and I'm sort of a late night person, so right at midnight, I'll sign up and I don't get in when I've been going to it. And then that's sort of disruptive. And then I called the person and then they helped me get in. So there's just mystery things like that. Like it was literally right at midnight and it was already full. Really? Yeah. Well, there's a thing with that and see, I think the idea of the book group is, cause I've talked to somebody about it, cause I've tried to get into a book group and I can't get in. Yeah. And people get in the book group and then they think they're in the book group. Right. Really what you have to do is, after you've met people, you go and set up a book group that has nothing to do with newcomers because otherwise, new people coming in never get to go to book group because it's people that are going every time. Oh. Does that make sense? I would just say for the mission of newcomers, nothing could be better than people meeting through newcomers and forming book groups that go on for years and years. Correct. Right. So you're not supposed to be in. That's music to me. Well, that's what I was asking. I'm like, so how does this work? Well, because it's a fresh month every month. Right, right. It doesn't matter. You have to sign up every month. You don't have this notion of sub-clubs and our software would not support it. So please, look at your highest priority. Yeah. But do, so then, if people go off and form a separate book club, like, how do you find out about that? You show up. You make friends with those people and you do your own thing. You show up and then you get on that email list. It's not through newcomers anymore. It's just a different, yeah, a different email list. But how do you find out about it? Well, it's people that you've met in the club, in the book club that are aging out or whatever. And they're doing it. Yeah. Oh, see, this is the first I'm hearing that. I've been to three or four book clubs. I am. Yeah. So I am in one of those and I am, I mean, I know, I feel your pain because I think I've been in the afternoon book club and then I signed up and I didn't get in. Like, oh, I know all those ladies. And I'm like, hey, I'm on the wait list. Can I get in? And they're like, well, no, I can't, like, full clout. Finally, the day of, like, Janie, you didn't come. I was like, oh, I'm playing pickleball. So sorry. Yeah. I would love to, I read the book. But, so. Okay. The one I'm in, the alumni one, it's like half people that are still in the club and half people that are aged out. Okay. And so we meet and we don't have anything to do with newcomers, but we don't have that meeting on any book club for newcomers because half the people still do the newcomers too. Right. So we like met at Java Cafe or we meet at someone's house that people are. So just, just keep trying and you'll meet the people. Okay. And there's a meditation group hosted by a former newcomer and none of the people are in newcomers anymore, but they still go to the group. And it's not the person who facilitates it, just sends out a WhatsApp and meeting, you know, the fourth Thursday. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. So it's very informal. Yeah. So I think there are a lot of, you know, people meet each other. They like each other. Yeah. And they know this is limited. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. But it was, but. And there's a mahjong group that did that too. That's extra, extra quicker. Okay. So I'm Jan and welcome to our house. We're happy that you're here. So I'm the chair of the newbie meet and greet committee. And what we're really trying to do is make the newbies feel really welcome. And so what I try to do is send out an email to all the newbies every time it's coming. And so I have a template and I basically send out the same thing every time. And it would be nice to be more creative, like a little more exciting. So if there was some way to have a, you know, augmented something to make it sound better and really more enticing, because I noticed when I send that out, I get a lot of signups. So, but it's not that easy to find. Yeah, yeah. You're gonna come? You're gonna sign up? Good, good, good, good. Yeah, so, and it's not that easy to do, to send out that email. So it could be easier. So I'm signing off for the AI analysis of this. So good luck.
