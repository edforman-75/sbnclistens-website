  "text": "Hi, this is Ed, and I'm making a recording of myself with my thoughts on the website of the newcomers. My first impression is that it's a very tired looking site. It just feels like an old person's home, and it just could be spiffed up a lot with better photography, better typography, better layout, just all the fundamental things. It looks like a 20-year-old website. My second issue is in finding things on the website, and particularly the things that are of greatest interest to me. What I'm often looking for is a particular event to register for. I'm often looking for what events am I registered to. I'm often looking for who else is going to the events that I'm going to. I'm interested in what events have openings this coming week. It's those kinds of questions that are really of interest to me, and that I find difficulty in accessing on the website. I think that the website needs to be warm and engaging, and potentially offer community resources beyond that which are done currently. For example, wouldn't it be great if we could just have an area that's questions from people moving to Santa Barbara, with just basic information, where to register to vote, where to pay your taxes, how to get a driver's license, just the basic things that people need. Perhaps what are the major non-profits in Santa Barbara, what are the best parks in town, things like that. I just think that that would, where to take your dog in Santa Barbara, I just think that that would be a great resource for the club to offer. The other thing, and this more gets to my official responsibilities in the club, is I'd like to have it be more self-service when it comes to customer support. I think that we could make it much easier for admins, chairs, and board members to find the information they're looking for, and to work their way out of problems. Too often, it's the simplest issues that get people hung up, and if there were an easy way for them to resolve those issues in the moment, I think it could increase satisfaction a lot. So those are kind of my major things. What would be my highest priorities? Well I think my highest priority would be, number one, to enhance the look and feel and make it feel representative of the members and the community. My second would be finding easy ways to get to things. The third, which I haven't mentioned, is to improve the calendar app, just to make it much easier to find events through browsing as well as searching. I think we could do a whole lot better. And number four behind that, I think perhaps would be a question mark in the corner, which got one to help or chatbot or left a message for the webmaster or something, but kind of provide more of a route for new users to make it easy for them to do what they want to do.",
