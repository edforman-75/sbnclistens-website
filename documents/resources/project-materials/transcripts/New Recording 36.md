## Full Transcript

I'm here with Peter. We're talking about the website. So what do you do on the website? Primarily look for events. And how does that work for you? I think it works well. I actually use the Wild Apricot app more than the website. So I couldn't tell you what challenges the website might have. I do think it would be nice if you organized the events. Because there's 20 to 40 somethings and then there's everything else. Put those in their own section or have a way to filter for that. Because you're scrolling through and you get interested in something and then I'm reading, oh, 20 to 40, can't do it. Yeah, I'm too young. I'm not 20. You're just 41. It's okay. You know how to go. But that's just one thought. Other than that, I don't have... When did you join and how was your joining experience? About 18 months ago. It was very easy from what I remember. Smooth. I haven't ever had a challenge. I think that signing up is easy for events. Information is plentiful. I'd be curious what other people's challenges are. There are some. But I use the app. Okay. Well, great. Thank you.
