  "text": "Aha, okay. Now, can you hear that? You heard that, I think. Did you? Say that again, John. I was trying to... I'm sorry, I apologize. Yeah, this call is being recorded now, as a matter of fact. Excellent. There was another button, unlike the one that I saw on Google. So anyway, I guess, you know, always updates and whatnot. In any event, I'm John Ruffin. I'm talking with David Warnock. And this call is in relationship to our potential revision of the Santa Barbara newcomers website. And David knows, David, you know that we're being recorded. I do. And I am in full agreement with recording this call and using it for the board's purposes. Great. Good. Thanks. Hopefully not too long here, 10 minutes or so. But I'm interested in your experience. Let me just, well, maybe you, why don't you tell me how long have you been in with the Newcomers Club and what's been your involvement? Betty and I have just finished up our three year term as newcomers. We're extended for that extra year. We've been involved in and active on committees throughout the entire period of time. My major focus initially was on the golf committee, the wine committee. But the first committee I ever joined was Mass Musica. And I continued on that throughout the entire three year period of my service for the newcomers, which we've usually enjoyed. Now, as I'm quite often, I was a co-chair of some sort, had administrative capacity and function. And therefore, my privileges to the website were not just as a simple user, but I had administrative credentials, if you will, privileges. And that, frankly, colored my impression and my utilization of the website. Of course, I would log in as an individual and that was appropriate and so forth. But also as an administrative person, I could see, you know, what was going on on the back behind the scenes, if you will. And I have to tell you, I was impressed with the wild, you know, the butterfly application. I'm sorry, the wild apricot application. Butterfly is another application I'm involved in. I was impressed with the wild apricot application in terms of what they were doing for nonprofit organizations like the newcomers in terms of its flexibility and really the power of the whole approach. So, you know, put me down in the column of really impressed users that thought a lot of the system. Now, there are a couple of bumps in the road, of course, with everything, but it would be great if it could be addressed. The biggest problem I had with the whole process, frankly, was dealing with people who were not savvy users and, you know, wanted to rely strictly on their phone. And the phone, I rarely use the phone app, quite frankly, because I felt it was underpowered and gave conflicting information. And really, it was very frustrating as a committee chair to try to communicate to someone and say, yes, I know your phone app says you registered. But you know what? I'm looking at the actual log here and your registration expired because you didn't pay within the first 15 minutes. And having not paid, you're not actually registered. But my phone app says I'm registered. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So anyway, the point is a major area of improvement would be to improve the interface and the productivity, the connectivity of the phone app. Like it or not, most users do not need access to the administrative privileges and are fairly naive in their use of the application. And I had more problems with the phone app than I did with the computer based web application. I hope that's a useful comment for you. Absolutely. I mean, you answered a lot of the questions I didn't even ask yet, which is the nature of your experience and which has been significant. And given all the committees that you've been on, you've used the website actively, I would say every week, needless to say, correct. Is that fair? Indeed. Yeah. And so you've also given me your general impression of how it works as a user and not as a, you know, one who can get to the behind the scenes, so to speak. But just as a simple user who's dialing up and getting on and trying to schedule events or find out about things through those eyes. What would you say would be your experience in both positive and negative in terms of just the normal user trying to get on the website? From the normal user, the real impact is every Sunday morning when you get the news and you're looking at events that are, you know, just announced and you're making plans and you want to contact your friends and so forth and so on. And I found the e-news a hugely important source of information and being able to go to the app. And again, even if I, you know, I rarely use the phone app, quite frankly, I would always because, you know, I'm on my computer all the time anyway. So I just log in as a user, not as an administrative person. I would log in a user and I felt the user interface on the computer based system was helpful. It was easy to find events. It was easy to sort events. And I like the feature of being able to see who's actually already registered for events and say, oh, OK, yeah, those are my pals. I want to go to that event. So I thought that was that was worthwhile. In terms of the downside, the only criticism I would raise, perhaps, is that sometimes the event descriptions and especially save the date kinds of things or conflicting scheduling things were not as transparent or not as clear as they could be with respect to the perspective of the individual user. Yeah. Yeah. OK. But but generally you use useful in terms of its functionality. How do you feel about the appearance of the Web site in terms of from just fresh eyes, in terms of how it how inviting and how you can move around and that sort of thing? Well, the the cosmetics, you know, it's like anything else, there's a learning curve. And, you know, John, in my daily life, I deal probably with 10 different Web sites with various. And so, you know, I'm I'm not as wowed and impressed by the latest little, you know, wrinkle or cosmetic, you know, is the color right, is the font right? That kind of stuff. I'm looking for utility. You know, I'm going to get in. I want to do my business and I want to get out. And so from that perspective, cleaner, simpler, better is my approach. Any terminology that you found at all conflictual in terms of the drop down menus or. Those are two things that yes, I I understand the question. But, you know, I so I personally don't have any problems with that because, you know, I come to this with a background where I've used such tools a lot. So the notion of having a drop down menu or, you know, needing to search or, you know, whatever is is very familiar, very comfortable. And, you know, it's it's something that, you know, you get used to. There's I mean, there's a current overlap of information between all these Web sites. It's very comforting, quite frankly. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. And so needless to say is with your experience and past and present experience in this, it's working fine. Given this opportunity of a similar vision and we're going to look at revision in terms of functionality, we're going to try to interview a dozen or so people. Well, maybe more because there's about eight of us on this committee from from the board and each time to talk to about three people. So but in terms of the given this opportunity, what from your view and your experience, would you advise as an opportunity to improve? OK, that's a great question. You know, the good news and the bad news about newcomers is it reinvents itself every six months. Astounding. It really is. And, you know, there is, you know, it brings a freshness and Christmas to it. You know, and setting up an event, you know, to hear someone say, well, you know, we did that three years ago. The answer to that is, well, you know what, 90 percent of the current members were here three years ago. So that's OK. So so the renewal process, I think, brings a vibrancy that's really important. But the problem is the lack of a formalized institutional memory. You know, the only behind the scenes person that really has any long term history is Charlie, the bookkeeper of all things. You want to know something else, Charlie? Yeah. So. So as an example, there was something that we had made a very nice arrangement with the Santa Barbara Symphony that worked great for this term. But to be able to pass that baton to the next term, you know, there's there's not a facile way to have some kind of archival process or some way to, you know, to put in a note to the file for the information. You know, this is how you set this up ongoing, you know, that sort of thing. So finding a way to kind of bridge, you know, this every six months kind of turnover thing, I think, is a bigger challenge. And part of that, quite frankly, this whole business about the jot forms and how you set up an event, how you manage an event is really complicated. And I frankly and I, you know, because I was a chair on a couple of committees for, you know, on a continuing basis from at least five of the terms I was involved in newcomers, that meant that I had a familiarity with that whole process. So I wasn't starting off, but the brand new person that's just getting going is really challenged by that. And the training process that is undertaken in good faith is really not adequate to allow a committee co-chair to be facile in terms of how to understand and how to use to its greatest potential all the all the all the power of the system for organizing, you know, large scale events. Now, if you're having an event for 12 people and, you know, OK, fine, that's that's probably not a biggie. But I, you know, the committees that I worked on in the events that I frankly feel the most proud about were large scale, big events that were hugely successful in terms of the customer satisfaction. And quite frankly, you know, we don't talk about profit in the nonprofit world, but the revenues exceeded the expenses and that's that helped everybody out. So the training process really needs to have some hard, hard look at two issues. One is the the venue for training has been woefully inadequate. I mean, you've got to have people online and they can't be you can't be in an environment where the web, you know, where the Wi-Fi system bogs down because there's more than two users on it at one time. I mean, that's frankly, it's embarrassing. The other thing I'll say to you quite candidly, and I know this is being recorded and just fine because I'm done, I'm finished. But I dealt at times with vice presidents of activities, which is an absolutely critical job. I mean, every Wednesday they are involved with approving these things and so forth. But I, I was involved with vice presidents of activities who frankly knew less about the organizing an event than I did as a previous co-chair. And I think the requirement for the VP of activities absolutely has to be someone who has been a not only a co-chair, but, you know, in these committees, there's usually one person ends up being the designated hitter in terms of doing the back office work, you know, getting the job forms done and getting up and running. And then what's really critical, especially if it's a big event in the last week, you have a series of cancellations. People can't come. Well, is there a wait list? How do you manage a wait list? All of that is is important. It's not simple, but it's it's critical to having a successful event, you know, so you don't have people being left out in the cold. And oh, my gosh, there were slots available. So sorry. But having somebody serving as a VP for activities who had not been previously already working with the system and understanding all the ins and outs of what it takes, I was really a negative. Yeah, they've got to do something about that. I mean, it's it's astounding to me that this that this thing works as well as it does. Isn't it? Given the whole turnover every six months. Imagine running an organization, a corporation like that. It's astounding. I've often thought, why not at least a year? And maybe it's because some people don't want to continue for more than six months. I don't know. But the learning curve just hits the peak at the time of transition. That's right. That's right. You know, it might be and it would be a good person to talk to about this. Just as there is a paid bookkeeper. OK, Charlie. Yeah, yeah. Was a newcomer herself. I think there ought to be a paid. Technical kind of person that really could be there, you know, as the glue to hold together the the all the aspects of, you know, the mechanics of getting these projects up and running and, you know, being a real resource person to hold things together with respect to the website and its forms and scheduling and developing the event and so forth. So the people involved who are involved for six months can spend their creative energies, you know, developing events, having big ideas and not being bogged down by the mechanics of which are so critical. But the mechanics of what I'm going to refer to as the back office work. Yeah, boy. I mean, that's that's such a great idea. And and let's face it, we can afford it. Yeah, that would be money well spent. We always, you know, the current president is trying to trying to figure out how to spend money and rather than, you know, leave too much in the kitty. And so, but having having that kind of capacity, I think, would be would be significant. So, again, all of the all of these great ideas we should have you sit in on this, given all your your background as well. But I appreciate having this in the recording and. I'll offer one one final thought for you, you know, because it's a great opportunity for me to kind of show this out there. I, I felt very strongly about having formal printed name tags for our events. Now, again, our my perspective was large events, you know, 50, 60, 70 people. And the reason for a printed name tag is we were able to make some help and Leslie Chavez was really involved in that. And the template for generating a name tag turned out to have a wonderful little field that was simply being used to put in a gold star. If someone was a newbie and it turns out that was a free text field, you could put anything you wanted to in that field. And so we use that rather than just identifying newbies with a gold star, we would write newbie or write committee member or write, you know, guest or write host or, you know, things like that. The other. And that's nice. That's cosmetics. That's just, you know, OK, fine. But the other thing that was really critically important for me as a chair, looking at an event with 70, 75 people, is that if I saw anyone walking around with the name tag, that was a pencil Sharpie handwritten name tag rather than a printed name tag. That was a clue that that person may not have been registered or may not have been registered properly. And I followed up on several of those. And yes, indeed. You know, they had somehow managed to figure out where the event was and showed up and said, oh, I don't have a name tag. Golly gee, I registered. Well, often it was that case for somebody who registered but didn't pay and they thought they were registered. But, you know, whatever. So I like the printed name tags as an audit function. You know, they're nice and, you know, so forth. But as an audit function. Yeah. Quick, quick spot. And then, you know, I would I would take take that person with the name tag aside and say, well, you know, you really didn't register properly. Well, enjoy the event, you know, have a good time because the rest of us are going to and I'll follow up with you after the event to make sure that you, in fact, are right. I mean, but that's that's a mechanical, you know, that's one of those back office things that if you're overwhelmed with just doing a dot form in the first place, the notion of doing printed name tags. Oh, my God. Absolutely. No, it's it's a it's a critical aspect for me, having hosted a number of events and whatnot and always, always wanting to make sure we get this this printed name tags. And there's there's there is a function somewhere in in one of the one of the forms where you can take the list of registration registrants and convert it to a a file that will automatically print as opposed to doing it manually. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's it's very hard. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's a mail merge function. That's it. That's the only word. Yeah, that's been in words since 1902. That's a function that should be more well known. It's not not a problem when you get 12 people. But, you know, in some of these events where you've got over 100 people, it's an issue. That's right. David, I don't want to take longer on this recording, but I can't tell you how much I appreciate your wisdom and advice on this. Is there any last thing in terms of how what we might contribute to this new design that you would feel would be appealing or, you know, supremely functional other than what you've already mentioned? Well, so the last thought has to do with the recent initiative that Steve Denton has taken on and which you're very familiar with in terms of the alumni relations and how to fill a, you know, if you've got 12 positions that are, you know, 12 registrations have been filled, how we can fold alumni into that in a comfortable kind of way. That that really needs to have that could work really well. And, you know, I think to have a nice cemented relationship with a formal alumni group would be a positive. And quite frankly, I, you know, as an alumnus, I'd be willing to pay 25 bucks a year for that privilege. Yeah, that's a great, that's a great note. And yeah, and indeed, yeah, I'm well wrapped into that. We need to, we need that system and that policy work. My apologies to you again for having put you through the wringer. Well, but, you know, we made it work. Well, you made it work. You made it work. And so, David, listen, I'm going to I'm going to close the recording here, but I'll have a few more comments. So thank you.",
