  "text": "You hear that? Yep. Okay. So, I'm talking to Christine Beckman who's a newbie to Santa Barbara Newcomer's Club and this record is being recorded. We're going to discuss impressions with the newcomer's website and so Christine, you know we're being recorded, correct? Yes. Let's just start off by you just saying when you came to Newcomer's and when you signed up and then your impressions of the registration or signing up process, how did that go? Yeah. So, I think I've been a newbie for about six weeks, I want to say. Maybe a little bit longer. I want to say it was the beginning of October and we're now in the middle of November. I thought the signing up process was really quite easy. I didn't have any trouble at all and the first thing I did was join, go to the orientation, no the meet and greet and then the orientation so I did those things in pretty quick succession which I think helped me get to know how things worked pretty fast. Yeah, good. Do you remember going through the sign up process, the application form at all? I don't know if I remember it in great detail. Let's see if I can. It's easy to forget. I don't remember it being difficult. I had to say that I had moved in the last 18 months and that I was living here more than half time and I forget what the other criteria were. Yeah. So, I mean, it's a little bit of background whether you had special skills, whether you'd be ready to open your home. Oh, right, right, right. Those things too. Uh-huh. I was a partner in the club, blah, blah, blah, that sort of thing and then there's also a particular interest to me in my role as a parliamentarian is there's a couple of boxes that need to be checked. One is the Santa Barbara newcomers event waiver and media release and it gives you a chance to click on that and then read the whole thing and you check a box and if you check the box then you go to the next step and then there's another box that says, it still says Santa Barbara newcomers terms and conditions and there's a box to be checked there and you click on that then you get another readout which isn't actually terms and conditions, it actually says Santa Barbara newcomers club agreement and these are some of the things we were going to fix. But do you remember reading those documents at all or did you just? I'm pretty sure I didn't read them and I just clicked okay. Yeah, okay. That's a really useful admission if you will because we need to just clarify that and that's what I think probably what I did and probably what most people do is like this has got to be fine, I don't want to read all the fine print, blah, blah, blah and so I'm clicking the box but we just want to make sure that actually if somebody actually clicks on that wants to read the whole thing which somebody has recently and they raise some questions. So this is one of the things that we've been trying to figure out is, does anybody care about those boxes or how do we do this, how do we do that better? So I mean, so I logged on to the website before we started talking and I can see them on my profile and I can open them and read them, I don't see anything that makes me wish I'd read it ahead of time but I guess I suppose, I'm not sure what people would be worried about but it seems pretty straightforward. Yeah, it is with some exceptions and if you're on the website then there's under and the different drop downs can be a little confusing, there's committees, directories, members and what not. Under members, you get member information where your profile is, club reports and then at the bottom is something called governing documents and the governing documents, that's actually my realm that I'm kind of responsible for all that detail and so if you open some of those things up like the bylaws or policies and procedures or data privacy policy, that's those sorts of things, then there's a lot more detail and then some of these things have been updated more recently than others and quite frankly, we're going to revise, we need to revise all of those in the coming month or so and that's a bit of what's on my plate with some of the other. Is that because there's concerns or you just want to make sure that they all still make sense today? Yeah, it's mainly the latter. Our website platform, it's called Wild Apricot and that's the website host or whatever, wants us to revise and update our data privacy policy language and in doing that, it actually has a direct relationship to some of the other documents, so there's language that needs to be consistent in some of the other documents, bylaws and policies and procedures particularly and there's also just some kind of nudgy language in there in terms of who's a member, who's not a member and who can come and who needs to sign a waiver and all that, that just needs to be kind of cleaned up and so I mean, that's what all that's about and then officer descriptions in terms of what all the different members of the board do and including parliamentarian, which is me. Right, you need to make sure we're following the rules. You're following the rules, I'm a cop, yeah, so it's all a lot of fun but there are things that could be concerning if something gets out of whack because we got a lot of people doing a lot of things and they could be, so we need insurance and protection in any event, so good. Well, that pretty much, that answers the question I had about signing in. What's your general impression and you've been on the website, you've been doing things and signing up for stuff, what's your general impression about how easy it is to get onto the website and find your way around and sign up? Yeah, so I mostly have been using the app. I think someone early on sort of said that the app was sort of the way to do it, so I mostly use the app. I haven't logged on to the website a ton but as I did it, you know, before we talked, I said my only challenge with the app was when there was something that I couldn't do, I couldn't figure out how to tell the committee chair that I wouldn't be there, like I couldn't figure out who the committee chair was and all that, so, but I can see here on the website that if I clicked on an event that I was registered for, well, maybe not on the, there is a little button to say to contact the committee, so that I don't think is on the app, maybe it's just on the website or maybe I missed it on the app, but that's the only trouble I've had is figuring out how to contact, figuring out who to contact if I can't attend something that I have registered for. Right, right, exactly, yeah. And curiously enough, I use the website more than the app, to be honest with you, I just had gotten more comfortable with the website, but yeah, so there's some little odds and ends like that, the website is more complete, has more space and all the rest of it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I should have gone to the website, that would have solved the problem I had had. Yeah, and the website gives you more information on the committees and on who the committee chairs are and what their addresses are and that sort of thing. Yeah, no, it seems I will use it more after sort of our conversation, because I hadn't realized all this stuff was actually there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and so, you know, what we're going to be rumbling around with is, is all the right stuff there, is it easy to find, is it too much, is it not enough? And so, and also, just in terms of the inviting nature or welcoming nature of the website, is it, you know, my particular view is it's not very pretty, but except that some of the some of the photos that are put in in the in the events are better, but we could, we could small set up a little bit, but I don't know, how does it, how does it appeal to you? Well, I mean, there's just, it's a lot, I think what's hard to do is figure out how do you present it in a way, given how many events they are, that it's not overwhelming and easy to find. So, I guess if that's not a straightforward thing to do, right, so I can see like the color coding on the months, but, and, you know, and I think, and I guess, and there's the issue of like, do you, when, when the new registrations open, how do you know, how do you find, how do you know which the new ones are that are just opening versus ones that have been opening? But it looks like that website sort of seems slightly better than the app for that, too, that you can sort of see what it's organized by the things that are opening up soonest. Right. You're going to have to register for come Tuesday. Yeah, right. So, yeah, I don't love the calendar view. I sort of, I personally, I find that the font's smaller. It's like, I like the lists more than I like the calendar view, but that just might be my, but I can switch between them. So. Right, so that's, that's an important observation, and, yeah, so, and I, I share that, I like the list view. It's more, more engaging, and particularly with the pictures and stuff, but you, you find it, do you find it easier or difficult to switch between the two? No, it's, it's pretty easy. It's pretty easy. Yeah, I mean, I guess what, maybe what you would want would be a way to sort, to sort of say, is that maybe there is, and I can't see it, but like, you know, I'm interested in, you know, these three, this, you know, the, the, the Epicurious and the Local Heritage and the Water Sports or whatever, and so I could click on those and see what the upcoming events are for that. I mean, because there's so many different things, I don't, if there's a way to do it, I'm not sure how to do it, how to just sort of sort by just certain kinds of events. To do a search, to have a search button, yeah, I think we have no, no. Yeah, or, or even just a filter that says, right, here, here are the, I, I, and to be able to click the categories, the committees, and say, I only want to see these committees events. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's, there is things. That seems like the most difficult thing, is that there's just so much, and it's overwhelming, and how do you, how do you, how do you help people organize it so they don't, they can see just the parts that they're most relevant to them? Yeah, I think that's really a very useful way of stating it as well, is, and I have the same, the same issue. I find that, that moving back and forth, in some cases, which is calendar view, and the calendar view may not go through the next month, you need to switch back to, you switch back to the list view or whatever. So, in order to get to the following months, and so, but that kind of navigation is something that I think we're going to, we're going to, going to pay attention to. So, having, having said that, is, is that the principal frustration, or are there any other frustrations that you, you've experienced in terms of working with it? Yeah, no, I would say my most, the most, the prevalent one is just figuring out how do I figure out which things to look through, and having to scroll through a lot of things to say, I remember seeing something, you know, and trying to find it again, because there's just so many things. Yeah, yeah, I mean, in the month of October, I think we had 100 events. Which is amazing and awesome, I mean, that's not a complaint, but it, but it is, it can be hard then to, to navigate. Yeah, yeah. How to sort, yeah, because not everyone's going to, because they're not interested in everything, of course. Yeah, no, and I think the, the, the question of, of sourcing and searching and maybe having a filter could be a really good, a really good opportunity. And then the other question is for, like, if your schedule changes, you don't want to make it too easy for people to cancel, because then that's, you know, because then that's a hassle for the committee chairs, sort of finding that right balance that if, you know, I've registered for something and I can't show up, how do I, how do I let people know? I did get off the wait list for one event, and that worked pretty well, you know, I got a phone call and said, yes, I still would like to do it. And then I signed up to that, that wasn't through the website, but I guess that'd be the other thing you could do is you could have the wait list happen sort of through the, through the website rather than having it to be a phone call. Well, the committee chairs, when you register, they've got all your information, you know. Yeah, so they can decide how they want to contact you. Exactly. So, so they, in many cases, will do it through text. I mean, I've had texts, you know, saying, you know, waitlist and somebody's canceled, do you want to, do you want to take it? And let me, got to let me know in the next hour or whatever. And, and so, and yet the cancellation, yeah, you got to reach out to the committee chair somehow, either through their, their email address, but that's right. It's only through the email. There's not a cancellation button. Yeah, which is maybe, which is maybe right, which is maybe right. I'm just sort of like, that's the only thing I can think about that I had to work hard to figure out how to do. Right, not to make cancellation too easy here. Right. Think of it with one of, one of the people I've interviewed, a good friend of mine is, is David Warnock. I don't know if you've met him as yet. He's been, he's been the chair, long time member, been the chair of the Mass Music Committee. Well, they have, they have 80 to 100 people show up to the, you know, and you can imagine if, if 15 or so decide to change or cancel or whatever, I mean. Yeah, that's a hassle. Yeah. It's amazing. I mean, it's like crazy. So the, so the committee chairs, and then it also feeds up to the, to the vice presidents of activities because they, they get, they see that whole, you know, kind of play as well. I mean, the cancellations and then, and then the wait listing and knowing how many people on the wait list and who's, who's, you know, what the order is on the wait list. So it's a lot. So there may be some ways we can also streamline, streamline a little bit to make it easier on committee chairs. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not the right person for that because I haven't done that yet, but I can imagine that that makes a lot of sense to me. And yeah, so anyway, let's see. Have there been any, any other, whether it's be postings or specific pages that have been either confusing or problematic in terms of what you've seen? Not so far. I mean, I've, you know, it's only been six weeks. So, but, but it's been super easy. I felt, I felt like it's generally been super user friendly. Let's see. When you're talking about David, there's something else I thought about, but I've now lost, I lost my thoughts. So now I don't, I can't think of anything else. Yeah, I mean, that's all right. I, and, and this is basically getting your view from a fresh viewpoint, you know, just like having just signed up. I mean, what you told me about signing up, you know, the, the application is very useful. And so just your first impression. I mean, do you have people who, you know, my conversation with David, he had, you know, 15 different things that were of concern over time, over time showed up. And so we'll, we'll, we'll, we take the fresh view and the long view. Anyway. No, I'm pretty happy. Yeah. I think it's pretty cool. Yeah. It's a pretty terrific organization. It's just such a, such a neat way to meet people. I'm just super impressed by it. That's, you know, it, you know, like it being someone that studies organizations, the way they've structured, the way like it sustains itself without, it makes a lot of sense. I mean, I think it's sort of brilliant. I know, you know, speaking business here, I mean, as, as another person who understands organizations and systems, the fact that this, this whole thing works as well as it does and turning over every, the whole thing turns over every two years, but the leadership turns over every six months. And in some cases, there are people who overlap two terms, but rarely, never is it the president or, you know, in some cases it's the vice presidents of, of, of activities that will take a second term, but, but president turns over every, every six months. So if somebody is going to come in and figure out how to, you know, deal with all this, fortunately, these are a whole lot of smart people who sit. Yeah, yeah. Well, and I guess, and that's where you want a website and a, a structure that like the fact that the committee chair emails are to the committee's names. And so when the people change, you don't have to change the emails. Like I said, it feels like there's a lot of things that work well to sort of help with that kind of constant rotation. And so it makes it easy for people to come in and get up to speed and not to have things fall through the cracks. So I'm impressed with the attention to those kinds of details. Yeah. And so it's, it's somebody called the vice president of technology who, who shifts all that. So at the end of each term, VP, I mean, the email address is president at newcomers, new Santa Barbara, newcomers.com.org stays, it's the same email address, but, but the forwarding has to go to a different person. So. Right, right. Which that's an easy fix, right? That's an easy change, right? That's, that's, that makes a lot of sense. We've got 20 people on the board. So, yeah, so it's, it's a little crazy. It's great. Anything, anything you'd advise from your experience and view of organizations and systems, et cetera, that would be useful in terms of this? Well, I mean, not, not, not so far, not in the time I've, I've had, I mean, it's, it's, it's a pretty, it's not, as you sort of said, it's not, it's, it's, it's, it's not a sort of fancy website, but it's really what you need is functional. So. That's right. It feels pretty functional. Yeah, we're not trying to, we're not trying to bring in a whole lot of new people who just find it. We're not looking for likes and people to join and whatnot from the general public. It's just, you know. Yeah. So it's, it's, it's a select community that people. Yeah, yeah. So I guess the only thing I would say would be the, the filtering of events would be nice on the app and the website. And then the, on the app in particular, it looks easy. It is hard to figure out who the committee, who the committee chair, who was organizing it. And so if I needed to contact the organizer to know who, who it was, that's, that's not easy to do on the website. I mean, on the app, that's not easy to do on the app. Yeah, and that, that is the, which is curious because it's a drop down that says committees that will tell you what the committees are and give you the email address for the committee chairs. But it won't tell you who the committee chairs are until you go to. Well, and that's fine, I guess. But even on the app, you can't even do that. Right. Like on the app, I can't find the committees. I can, you know, I can go to the events that I am registered for. I can see the information about it, like where it's going to be. No, I haven't gotten the thing for tomorrow. I don't think we've gotten the address yet that I am, but I can see who's registered, but I don't know who organized it. So like on the app, you can't really tell who organized something. So that's interesting. You haven't gotten the address for tomorrow, for Sunday social. I have not. I mean, I see you're on that list as well. Have you gotten that? I am. Yeah, I've got it. I can, I can give it to you. But I'm more concerned that you haven't gotten it. There's, you should have gotten an email. That is, it was now, because it would have been an email a couple of days ago, probably. I'll try to find it. No, here it is. Oh, it's from 12 a.m. today. 12 a.m. today. And it says Sunday social registration. Okay, yeah. Reminder, social, Sunday, reminder, Sunday social. Do you see that? Yeah, but it still just says private home. Oh, there it is now. And now at the bottom, it now says Bethany Marshall, Noel Circle. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I can see that. Okay. All right. So that's in the email, but it doesn't say anything on the app. So I would have had, but I guess that makes sense because you don't want people that aren't registered to be able to get it. So I, it's going to be coming to your email. That's the tricky part. It's going to be coming to your email. That's the tricky thing. Yeah. Got it. Yep. Yep. Yeah. And I think I can, I just, my problem is I didn't scroll down, right? Because I got the email and it says reminder. And I guess I do know it's coming in at the top. It still says private home. I didn't know. I didn't, I just would have, tomorrow I'm sure I would have scrolled down on that email to figure out where it was. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a little confusing because this address will be visible under additional information. And there's, there's nothing that says additional information there. So that's a little confusing. Yeah. Scroll down. It doesn't say the address. If you were looking for that heading, additional information, but then down at the bottom it says location. Bethany Marshall's place. All right. Well, that's good to know. Hey, now I have that in my calendar. So thank you for solving that, solving me. Tomorrow I'm going, oh my gosh, where is that? Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's a nice place. Bethany is, is co-chair of local heritage committee also. I'm going to say thank you and stop this recording. So, so Christine, appreciate your, your feedback on this. And this will be very helpful. Hang on for a second though after this. Okay. That's.",
