  "text": "OK. Here we go. So yeah, so I don't have to introduce you to this group. You're not going to know who you are. But yeah, so we were just saying that we generally use the app now. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, saying that my first six months or so, I would say I was solely using the website. And once I had downloaded the app and started to use that, that I pretty much never went back to using the website. But you did use it on the other side, like so for as a chair, a committee chair. Oh, is that what you're? Yeah, so from that perspective. So it's all of those things, too. OK, OK. Yeah, so as just a member, that would be my experience. And then as a administrator or whatever, chair in the VP activities, I used it for the always. So if you can think back about when you used it before you got the app, do you recall anything about it? Do you recall how easy it was to use it to sign up for events? Or how you used it, what made it good, what made it frustrating? Yeah, well, what I recall, even though this seems like a long time ago, is I definitely use the calendar. And to me, that's great because it's kind of the month at a glance and pretty time efficient in terms of looking through what's coming up and what you might be interested in. And then as I recall, tell me if I'm wrong, didn't I register just by clicking on the? Yeah, you click on the calendar. Yeah, you just click on the calendar, yeah. Kind of real similar to how it does in the app. Right. So I didn't have any troubles logging in or signing up. I also, the other feature I used, I would say, is the member, the directory. Yeah. So that if I, especially at the beginning, because you're going out and you're meeting people and then you're wanting to, well, I guess either contact them or whatever. So using that, the directory, I thought was user-friendly and easy. I think finding the committee, in terms of the website, when I joined, looking at the committee list like we still have it now, I thought was really helpful. And certainly because they give you the email of who to contact if you have questions. And then, and it kind of clarifies exactly what's available. Because when I was coming in, I was really sure that what I was going to do is get involved with volunteering. And at that time, it was before Volunteers in Action, and they had, I forget what the, there were two other committee names that were kind of the same thing. And they just didn't really make, they weren't clear, the description wasn't clear to me, and it really didn't come across as exactly what it was. And so I think that, I was confused by that, but then it turned out that that, in fact, was a little confusing, just to each people within the club. And so that's when they created the new Volunteers in Action. But other than that, I do find the committee descriptions as helpful. I was just talking to someone who, because, of course, now it's full court press on replacing people on the board and things like that, and that finding those board member descriptions, it's not so obvious. That's, yeah, I can't say I looked for that. So it is there. I didn't know if it was there, but it is there. It's under Governing Documents, which you wouldn't necessarily look for. Which is the very bottom tab on that, so that isn't all that visible. Because I actually even came across this a couple of times while you and I were working on things as administrators. But I don't know if the, when the general public isn't, let's see what else is on that page. Well, yeah, I don't think this page is that well known or visible, because I know a lot of people always talk about the third year process. And of course, it's the first box on that page. So maybe that is something where it's not as, doesn't pop up or isn't featured as. And that's that member page is also where you have to go to find out on the web what events you're ticketed for. You have to go to your profile. You have to go to the member page. You have to go to your profile. And then you could then, there's like a little, like really lightly fonted tab that says My Event Registrations or something like that. Yeah, I see it, My Event Registrations. I never, OK, Leslie, I've never even been here. Yeah, that's the way that you, that's the only way on the web that you can find your ticketed events, which is like super easy to do on the app. So yeah, there's that. I think that thing needs to get. Well, and to your point, first of all, I haven't looked at, I've never seen this part. So yeah, there's that. I've been in it three years now, but the other thing is it makes me think, because I remember, other than the third year application, people not finding that, the profile was a thing, which I guess I can, I'm logged in as Richard right now, but, so yeah, so we don't, like his address is not updated. So I feel like that was a question, people that wanted their address changed and just didn't know how to do it. So yeah, there's quite a bit on that page that really isn't something that people are that familiar with. So that's interesting. So maybe it just needs to be a little bit more like another kind of website where like your account would be kind of one of the main things on the front page. In the beginning, yep. So you would have your account and then you should be able to find like events you're in and that kind of stuff should be a little more front and center. Well, it even has the, gosh, I'm getting familiar with the page, the join a committee page too, how to do that. And that's kind of clever. It just takes you to the committee page. Yeah. Kind of a different version of the committee page, unfortunately. Okay. And then, so let's see. So under the, oh, how to's, everything. Wow. Yeah. I have not used this. There's a lot here. There's a lot there and it's, but it's not organized in a user-friendly way, I don't think. This is funny. One of these things, registering two members on one login. I know that was an issue for dining in. And so. Yeah, I've actually, I saw that and I've actually done it. It does work. Did it work? Yeah, it does work. Yeah, it does work. It's just a little counterintuitive and you would never think that you can. I just had actually today, somebody asked, like, can I do that? But it was for an event that's disabled. Yeah, so you can do it. And I was gonna, I have to answer this person who has a question. So you did use these instructions successfully and do it? I did. And I remember seeing that at one point, I think as I was looking at that page in order to, I think it was when I was posting the reimbursement policy, the update there. And we took out some, I think we were looking at it when we did the cleanup and we took out some stuff that was old and not relevant. But anyway, so. Well, so this is kind of, I mean, this is off topic, but this is kind of something that's important because it was an issue, dining in is an issue, but like for other things too, because a lot of these couples, I guess that's an issue is a lot of the couples don't have the same last names. And so if you're doing something where the organizer, whether it's a lawn bowling or whatever, dining in for sure, because you don't want to send them to two different houses, right? So sometimes it would be convenient if it was in on one login. Yeah, that's another, that's an interesting point in terms of that, because I know on your profile, you do name your significant other, but I don't know where that would show for the purposes of, yeah, like that, like a dining in or something else in order to connect those people. I'm not sure. Right, because it's really difficult. I'd say the majority don't have the same last name. I mean, it's in the profile, but. Yeah, okay. I'm actually looking up a profile, everybody, which is like kind of roundabout the way, but yeah, there is a way to do it. I don't know that it's still even links it necessarily because you have to put in the other person's email address so that they're registered under their email. Oh, I see. So, okay. But what happens is that if it's a pay thing, then the person who's doing it is paying for both. So like whatever credit card you have attached to your name is the one that's paying for both, even though the registration is going under two different names. Right, okay, so that doesn't, okay. So yeah, one thing that was pointed out to me, and I was kind of like told the person, she was asking on the calendar, it'd be nice to know like when you're supposed to, when it's open for registration and when is the last day you can register. Oh. And then I said, oh, well, it's in the title of the thing. It should be like, of course it's just there. And then I went and looked at the event calendar and that piece does not show. No. The event calendar. And so I would have actually have to open each thing to see when it's open, because it'll show on the, you know, upcoming events that aren't open yet will be on the calendar. Right, for sure. You don't, you'd have to open it, click on it. To find out that it's not open yet. You can't open, you can't register for it yet. Right. So I don't know how to do that. Maybe that's a color code that needs to happen. That's a good, that would be an easy fix, I think. Yeah, there's still some things on that event calendar that are showing as orange and I don't know why. I was talking to Doyle about it and we don't know why they're orange. That is so funny. There's something about them that makes them orange, but we don't know what it is. And it's not just the stride by the tides, it's some other ones too. Oh, I see wellness, yeah. So I don't know. I need to like see if I can figure it out. But yeah, maybe having a different color for events that are going to be open soon. Sure, I like your, I like that idea. That's a good idea. Yeah, very good idea. And I bet pretty easy. The other thing we're thinking about is some way to make it easier to cancel or to communicate that you want to cancel without having to like send an email to the committee. And also like there's not a link on the event, on the app anyway, there's not a link on the event to connect to the committee. You'd have to like go find the committee. Like on the app, there's not an easy way to say that you want to cancel. On the web, I think it's a little easier because all that information is there, the email addresses and everything are there. But there's not- Do you want to make it easier? Like your event registration that you're looking at, I registered for this event and you know, to like, I actually, I can't go, you know, like a button to push or a direct link to emailing that committee. I think there's something in the event description that says contact this committee, but if you click it, it takes you to the committee page and then you have to go find the committee. Right. And then figure out the email. Yeah, no, that is definitely extra steps, but I think that also sort of takes away, well, I mean, it would be nice if there was a button that went right to the chairs. Yeah. That requests to cancel. I mean, you just don't want them to be able to cancel that easily. So maybe it's like request to cancel or something like that. Yeah. I mean, there's automated emails that happen when you register for an event. Exactly. There's an automated email that if you request to cancel, that would go to the event organizer that they would have to- Yeah. It would go to the same person. Not opt out of, like, would be by default, like- Right, and one, it would be going to the same person that gets the notifications that you registered. So I don't think that would be that hard. Doesn't sound like it. So there's that. I like that. What else? We're talking about other things that you look for. So you were looking at, you know, member directory is something that people look for, and that's pretty clear, because, you know, on the app, it's really clear. On the website, I think it's not that bad, because it's under directories, not under members. So you can easily find the directories, I think. Well, now that you're saying that- Is that not true? Oh, it's a, yes, it's a heading. So yes, you can find directories. Yes, members directory, yeah. Yeah. And then someone was asking about alumni, like, why can't you see alumni in the directory? And, you know, that's a good question to talk about, because, you know, the alumni are in there. They're just not showing once they graduate. And that's on purpose, but maybe that's something we can redesign. Well, why do you want to see them? Well, so the example was that, you know, you meet someone maybe at a public event, or maybe just out and about, and they say, you know, oh, I was a newcomer. I just timed out, like, you know, three months ago or something. And then you want to go, like, maybe you don't get their contact information, but anyway, like you would do for anyone else that you might meet at an event that is a newcomer, you might go home and, like, look them up, and then you might want to reach out and, like, you know, go have coffee with them or something, right? You can't do that for alumni because they're not in the, they're not showing in the member directory anymore. And you're saying, and we already are, usually the argument for all that stuff is just the whole maintenance and manage of it, but you're saying we're already meeting- They're already there, they're already there, and they're already, like, tagged as, do you want to receive the alumni emails? And, like, if we ever wanted to send emails to alumni, then we can just pick them and send emails. So they're in the directory. They're just not visible to current members or to each other. So anyway, it's just something to think about as they explore alumni. Changes they might like to make, yeah. I don't know if it costs money or anything like that, but they're in there already, so. Some other stuff we were talking, I was talking about with someone else was, one was archiving the e-news on the website. Would that be something of interest to be able to look at back? It would be certainly something of interest for the communications person to have, right? I mean, they're in the email log, so if I want to look them up, nobody else can look them up. Somebody said that that's kind of, like, a common practice for a lot of organizations just to have their, like, if they have newsletters, then just to have an archive. Like a history. Most of the information is over and done with in a week, but, you know, some of the features that we write or, I don't know. For the people who all of a sudden don't get the email, they would have another way of getting it. Every now and then you- You mean getting it from the website instead of getting it on their email? So- Yeah. Some people, like they say, I don't get the email, it doesn't come to my inbox for, and there's sometimes reasons for that. Like weird, glitchy reasons for that. But if that does happen, they don't have anywhere else to- Go find it. It might be like a lot of, like, space on the website that we don't need to spend. Yeah. Yeah, I don't have an opinion on that. I'll leave that one to you. What about other announcements or things like, well, the example was we're looking for next year, or next term's board positions. Yes. Like just like announcements like that, like a bulletin about- Sure. That's just a management thing, though. Somebody has to do that, right? Like keep updating it. Like just a tagline, like what we're looking for this week or this month or whatever, yeah. Yeah. You know, what are we focusing on this month? That could be. You know, because then sip and sign is one that you really want to advertise quite a bit. The new, getting new chairs, new board positions, all those things. That would be another way, other than the e-news of advertising those things, or a separate email. Or those emails that Steve sends out. Yeah. Yeah, it would be a requirement that somebody is actually looking at the website in order for that to happen. But like maybe if you're new and you're looking about joining the club, you know, that would be a time when somebody would really be engaging with the website. Yes. It might be good to have those kind of extra pieces of information more accessible. Yeah, like joining a committee. How to join a committee. For example, yeah. Or if you need to be a committee chair, or what's the advantage of this? And like, you know, are you interested in a leadership role? You know, some people come in hot and you want to do stuff like that. I know. But they don't know about it. We don't talk about it until like, you know. I want to talk about too, like a little bit on the backside as like on the chairs training side, like do you have anything to tell us about sort of how the website functions as a tool for chaired committees? Like what are the frustrations that they might've had about finding the information that they needed or? I think there's a lot of people that kind of get, you know, agree to get involved and don't really want to put the time in because you do have to sit down and get onto the website and you have to look around and, you know, spend some time on it. And I feel like there's a lot of people that just don't, you know, they're not going to do that. They don't want to do that. I don't know. I do think that the board meetings were a good or are a good way to keep some of that information in front of the chairs anyway. And then they need to, if they're delegating their tasks to their committees, they need to pass that down. I think the frustration for the committees probably is not everyone, first of all, has a good system like what you created for the volunteers in action with the database, like saving the descriptions and the context and all that. I know local heritage has that, you know, we had that, but I'm sure that that's not the case for all of them. And I think that's a little bit difficult because they feel like they're just starting again. I did like from the pop-up transition, she did have a binder. So I was able to hand that over. But I think that that's the main thing for committees is how do you take on this role and then have all the information you need about, you know, what's required, what have we done before? And then that should kind of kick your brain into what else could we do. But so what we, the way we, it seems my observation is the way we do it is it kind of leave it up to the committees, the individual committees. Yeah. So- Thinking like in the same way that the membership member tab on the front end could stand some zhuzhing up to make it just more, you know, modern and more sort of accessible and like clear as to what it is offering. Yeah. The chair tab is the same. You know, it's just, you know, it's a list of links. You know, it's not very like visually engaging. It's not, you know, that stuff doesn't have, bring a lot of like contextual information to it. It's just, you know, it's a list of doc. And that's the information in those links is good, but like driving someone's eye to like the right one is hard because they're just don't stand out. You know, they don't- So make it more like buttons or- Different way of arranging or displaying that information or presenting it or, you know, I think the information is fine. I just think the way that it's appears on the page leaves a lot to be desired. Well, even, I mean, to your point, even this members tab is literally just says members. Like you don't even know what that, you know, this has all the information that we were talking about, but you would never know that, right? So, yeah. So maybe the upfront needs to be more descriptive. Yeah. The headline, the tab- And the typing, yeah. Why do I click here? But then also like once you get there, it should be more than just like this, like list. Yeah. It should be something more. Well, what about, I think one of the, let's think about this. The one that the biggest challenges with the chair training or getting at your, basically it's chair training or the VP, anyone, any admin training is the fact that people get pretty confused about how to get to the different pages, like how you get back to the events page. You know, okay, here, you can hit this house logo. Okay, you can hit here. And really, for me too, it just was a bunch of trial and error. And you just keep going around and around and you're like, eventually you figure it out. But even then, if you haven't done it for a while and you get back on, you kind of forget. And you're like, which view am I in? The public view, admin view? Like there's gotta be a better way because that I think is actually probably the number one issue for people getting lost and confused in the website. Yeah. So how that would be fixed? I don't know. It's kind of like, why is the chair tab in the public view instead of in the admin view? Sure. You know, maybe it should be in the admin view and that way it's not confusing. It's very confusing. I mean, I was confused. I was definitely going back and forth. Even when you're showing people, sometimes I feel like, oh, well, I'll just click on the logo, you know, the house logo. Oh, yeah. Because there's like four different ways to do the same thing. Mm-hmm. And it was a long time before I even saw the page with the house logo come up. I feel like that's sort of like a navigational glitch. You know, like, why is that even there? I don't know. So actually I think that is the number one confusion is in people you don't know how to, for the chairs, you don't know how to get to the admin pages that you need. Yeah. And then when you're there, the only thing that I thought the best shortcut I had is once you're there in doing all your admin stuff and you want to check out what it might look like to someone else, then you go over and go to the website. That was, I forget where I figured that out, but that was my biggest trick to just kind of cleanly go back. But that's what I'm saying. It took, you know, it takes a while and not everyone's going to spend the time. And also when they get, like, when they get lost in it, I think then that's, then their confidence goes way down and they're not so excited. Yeah. Yeah. I was kind of thinking that maybe just the whole, everything that a chair is doing should be in the admin section. They shouldn't have to go back and forth unless they're just looking, like you said, for a preview kind of. Well, but now, so now I'm in the website. So all I have here is about events, why newcomers can be directors. So maybe that's when we're just logged in as chairs. Yeah. It only shows up when you're logged in as a chair. Okay. So, okay. So then once you're logged in as a chair, yes, the chair should only be on the admin view. Yeah. But instead we have this whole page of resources for them that's on the public view, right? Yeah. That's really, I mean, now that I think about it, that is the biggest complaint. Yeah. Cause you have to toggle back and forth and now I don't know when I'm supposed to toggle back and forth and for what reason. Yeah. I don't know. You can just visibly see, and I'm sure it was me too. You can visibly see people's confidence just drop. Yeah. Like, wow, I, you know, I'm never going to get this. And it is stupid. Cause even if you're trying to show people, it's confusing even when you're showing it to them. And you know, if you're thinking it's convoluted when you're explaining it, then it is actually convoluted. Yeah. I think if you just logged in and you know the first thing you have to do is go to the admin tab and then everything you need is there. Yeah. Yeah. And then that, and then whatever they need to do to like fix the access permissions, if that's possible so that they can't like do stuff they're not supposed to do. I thought he fixed a lot of that already. He has a whole matrix. I looked at it, reviewed it, sent it back. I never heard from him again, but he, I told him exactly what the people, you know, the way we operate anyway, you know, unless that changes. I think it's, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if that changes. I think it's probably fine. Yeah. And then the, yeah. Not about the website, but just then the other thing that we'll think about, well, for the tech side of it is the, I think that the whole, it just was too complicated for the training with the two point verification and all of that. And so I think that the smartest thing to do probably is just have the new chairs train with the old chairs under there, forget the two point verification and have the new chairs train with the old chairs under the existing chairs credentials and not have the actual training for the new chairs until that first week when they actually have got their information, they've set up their password. Just that first week. I think Carolyn was always thinking like, well, she wanted to have them hit ground running, which if that's true, I agree. But I think- If they don't have their own login, then it just, it's a circus. It was, it was terrible. So I think that would be the other thing is make the training that first week of the new term. So February, first week of February. Yeah, and then it would be more sort of applicable. Yeah, well, and they'd feel ownership, like they're starting instead of this sort of fake start or whatever. So yeah. So I think that that would be another thing, but it's not really a website. That's a good idea. Okay, I don't wanna, we have seven and a half minutes left before we get cut off here. Okay. But I think this is good. If you think of anything else as you're playing around, let me know. Okay. But yeah, just, we're just trying to like, really target a few key pages and to make sort of a, I think the signup experience easier and then the member engagement, we don't want the website to be the reason why people don't do stuff. So why is the website, why is the signup hard? I don't know if it is. They've gone around a little bit around like what the signup form contains. Like it didn't contain terms and conditions or waivers or something. There was something about the way it was worded that turned out like it wasn't correct, but nobody had complained. So it didn't stop people from signing up. It just that they didn't, it wasn't like technically as legal as it should have been, I guess. Okay. So I don't think it's like hard, but you know, they might have input from other people about that. Um, just a second, I'm just trying something. So I am, I am on as Richard and when I am clicking on the calendar, it isn't, it doesn't have a way to sign up. It's not, it doesn't bring you to a signup page. It brings you to the event. Yeah, it brings you to the event and the event should have a register button. What event are you looking at? I know, let me make sure I'm in the right month for one thing. I'm like been all over the place here. You know, where are the months here? I don't know. This isn't even showing the months. So let me try this one. Um, oh, register here, I got it. I think I was in a past one. Okay. Yeah, so I don't, I don't see that that was hard. I don't, I mean, Richard's never had any problem with it. He doesn't do it very often. I was going to interview Glenn, but he says I've never once used the website. Richard, Richard only uses the website. So I'll ask him if he has anything. Yeah, thank you. Perfect. Bye. Bye.",
