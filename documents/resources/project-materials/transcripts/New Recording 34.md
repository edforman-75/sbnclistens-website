It saved my credit card. They did. Really? I had to put my card in every single time. Maybe there's a way to do that. I have two credit cards in there. And it just goes on and on. It goes to that one that's used. Faster. So what were you saying about this? So when I... It'll come up on my phone. New events posted. And then I go into the events and I'm like, how the heck am I supposed to know which one was posted and when did it open? Because it's kind of confusing. Because we're finding that we don't know when things are posted because we're not getting in. You're not getting in. There might just be some time when things are posted regularly. So maybe we should... They're posted on that Monday night. Is it Monday night? Midnight. Theoretically. That's my knowledge. But you're saying that you don't get that information. I don't know. Yeah. It's a Sunday newsletter. These are the ones that are new. And then Monday night it should be posted. But midnight. And it's really popular ones. People stay up. But you're saying that it's hard to find out. I'm just putting this for the record. So when we talk about it, it'd be nice if it was... Here's all the new stuff. It's easy to find. Yeah. It was maybe a different color or something. Oh. Okay. Different color. Or you could click to see everything new. And it's just the calendar of what's new. And what's available. And it'd be nice to see the price, too. Before you click into it. Yes. Yes. You can. Oh, yeah. But you're clicked into it. Oh. And this is the app, too. We were talking more about the website. Oh. I just get the app. I think the app works better. Don't you? Well, they're working on that website. But they're completely separate. Because the app is Wild Apricot. And I don't know what they use on the website. But they're different. I did not know. I agree. It'd be nice to know the price. Because some people think, oh, that's cool. Oh, $100? No. That's cool for me. Okay. No. That's where I have my credit card saved. And on the website, you can, too. Mine's on both, I think. All right. Cool. Sure.
