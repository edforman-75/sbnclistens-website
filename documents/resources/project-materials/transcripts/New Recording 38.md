Hi, I'm interviewing myself about the website. First for new people, I think it would be very useful if there was a way that we could walk new people through how to use the website. Most people who are successful right away either go to the orientation and walk through it there or they meet somebody like Debbie Rare and have a personal view orientation step by step. So if there was some type of video or app or even a committee of people who would be willing to walk people through the website, the people that are sort of non-very computer literate would have a better experience up front. The people who are computer experienced don't have a problem, it's just that the people that aren't very computer literate do seem to have a problem. I also think that the navigation can be improved because people have a hard time finding where they want to go. I think they want to see what are my tickets, where am I going, and what can I sign up for right now? What's still available to me and I can go? I think it would be also good if the navigation was segmented by category, especially the 20 to 40s and the 40 and above so that people could find what they're looking for easier. So the navigation would be really important to make that clear. I think that it would be really important to include the day of the week of the events like Thursday or Friday because that's not always clear. If you sign up for the waiting list, it's not clear how many people are on the waiting list. Like if you're number one, you probably get in. If you're number 40, you won't get in. So I know in the library books it usually says what number you are in the queue. This should be possible to list on the website. I think that it also would be helpful to have the price of the events shown in the listing because sometimes you get interested in an event and you find out it's $105. So it might be good to have that be also available in the summary.
