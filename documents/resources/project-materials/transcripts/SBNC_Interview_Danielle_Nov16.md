Okay, there we go. Okay. Okay. All right. So, yeah, so the thing about what we're doing is we're just, we're, we've got some people who have volunteered to help us refresh the website because it hasn't been refreshed in forever. And so, and part of it is just really user experience so we're trying to like get some information from people who have used the website to find out, like, what, you know, what do they like about it, what do they don't like about it, what's frustrating about it and all of that, right. So, so there's some questions here about that we're just supposed to get warmed up but like I don't need to know, you don't need to tell me how long you've been here and how did you hear about it but let's like, let's ask that question. How did you hear about the newcomers club. I actually don't recall I think I just found it online. Okay. I think I searching and I think I found it on Google. Okay. I don't think anyone told me about it. Yeah, because like our dentist told us about it. So yeah so you just found it because you were searching and I think. Yeah. And what did what made you think about joining. Oh, well I just knew the area and wanted to meet people and just thought it would be the fastest way to get to know the area and just socialize. Have you been in a club like this before somewhere else or. Um, I can't I mean I wasn't there was a newcomers club, something similar when I lived in Rochester, New York, and my friend ran it and I remember going to a couple events with her, but I wasn't a member because I wasn't new. But I was included. I don't know how but I was, I knew it existed, something like this because a friend of mine ran something elsewhere. Yeah. Um, I know for us it's been a little, it's been a minute but do you remember at all like when you join like what it was like to join the experience of like signing up or any of that. I don't remember any, the first event I did I do remember going to like a meet and greet at the Rose Garden mission, and speaking with a couple people who were actually they were really great like just saying what kind of options are out there and how to get involved and, you know, just talking up the whole club. And joining I don't remember that being an issue. I feel like I just went on the website and clicked join and did yeah absolutely joining was not a difficult, right, simple. Yeah. Um, so yeah that was my experience too is I don't remember it being hard and I know like it I might have remembered if it were frustrating but I don't remember that so. I remember being able to sign up easily enough, I did have problem with apricot, and I was not able, I just recently put apricot on my phone again, because someone told me that it was so much easier. And I kind of forgot about it because in the very beginning, it was hard. Oh, actually, you know what I do remember that I had an issue signing up and I had to call. Her husband I can't remember what Patrick I can't remember what his role was at the time but there was an issue, actually, with like my password. Anyway, getting it signed up and they had to do something on their end. Okay. So, you're talking about how you recently put the app back on your phone so does that mean like for a while now you've been using the website exclusively to sign up for. Until about a couple weeks ago I was only using the website. Okay, so that's perfect because that's the part that we're trying to examine, and so a lot of people just use the app and they don't really mess around with the website so what, what's sort of the last or what kind of things do you normally do on the website what kind of things are you trying to accomplish. So, and I will say just before I say anything there that now that I put the app on my phone, it is much easier than the website. Yeah, yeah. So I just go to the calendar a lot to see, see, you know what events are coming up. And then when I'm looking at event, sometimes I will look and see who's going. But I do find that when I'm in the website trying to do this. I have to page back a lot. Yeah. To get back to the calendar if I want to start again if all of a sudden I look at something I pick a date I look at something. I feel like I'm, I have to go back a lot more steps that way than with the app. Yeah, and when you're searching for an event like how do you do that on the app. The app it just comes, I think, I think the website, I go to the calendar and I just look at the dates. I kind of look at the color coding. And I haven't been great about like the, you know, the email that comes out on Sunday night which kind of. Now I'm actually paying more attention to that. It'll give me like a highlight of, you know, what's still open and what will be coming up because sometimes I'll go and it'll be like, you can't sign up for another week or two. And I'm like, oh, I was going to sign up because you see it. And you have to remember to go back the next week and sign up. Right. I have been using this Sunday email more than I did before. But I do look through I just kind of like look through because I because I've been in it a while I've done a lot of the events and a lot of them are, you know, repeat so I don't do those. Is there anything that you wish like any functionality that you wish there were while you're looking for events like that. I don't know if there is and I just am not aware of it. But if you could just go to the, the committee, or, you know, the event that you're looking for say girls night out, just bring up all the things. I noticed it's the app has a search bar, a search field and you can put in a keyword and it'll bring up that but on the, on the website, it doesn't. Right. So you just have to scroll through the calendars and I think it would be easier if you could pick whatever committee that you think or, you know, I don't know what you call them actually committee, I guess, pick it and then go through and see what they have. And I will say, because I just happened to look at the girls night out. Sometimes, I think it's a little frustrating it'll be like a hold the date or that it'll be. Oh, it's registration full but then there's no names. Mm hmm. I'm like, is it full because it says no one's registered. Yeah, so there was one the other day which might be one that you might have seen where the posting was had some things that were done wrong. And that's why the names weren't showing. So we just fixed it. But Allison the chair of that committee reached out to me just for kind of another reason and when I went into her event to look to see like what's going on I noticed that there was box that's supposed to be checked to that allows the names to be shown wasn't checked which meant none of the names were being shown so that wasn't on purpose that was a mistake. But yeah, there's little things like that, that, um, you know, on the other on the back end you know I'm sure they would have some questions some things to say about what would make it easier. So, yeah, so it's important to see who's going to be there I think that's a lot of times some one of the things that makes it that affects our decision to sign up for something. Right. Yep, I agree. Yeah. So yeah search bar I think for me anyway it would be helpful, but it sounds like for you to and being able to search by category by committee or even just by a keyword, either way, that would be helpful. Yeah. I know like, and I'm, you know, this is an interview about you but I'm just wondering if you ever experiences when I'm scrolling through the calendar on the website, you know, when you get to the bottom, you have to let go. I think you have to go back to the top in order to go to the next month. Right. Right. I agree you have to go yet up to the top to the left to the back to go to the, or should go back to the, the screen where you can actually select select next month. Yeah. Yeah. The bottom where you scroll down to. Right. At least I don't think that's right. Right. So let's go back to the top in order to go to the next month and now you go, yeah. So that's, if there was something that had like, and I don't know if there is but an area where it tells you, you have to sign up by a certain date or signups open on a certain date. It should say that in the title of everyone. Right, but I was just wondering like if there's, if there was a certain date. Because sometimes they, you have to sign up by a certain date and some it opens a certain date. Yeah. Yeah, the opening date is always in the title or should be in less than. So the opening date is in the title and that's why like on the e-news there's the new ones that are coming open on Tuesday. If you're looking at it on Sunday, you open it, you can't sign up for it because it's not open until Tuesday. That's just a number of times. Or a week later. It's just until from Sunday to Tuesday, like those events are open on actually Monday at midnight, you know, or Tuesday morning at midnight, however you want to look at it. I thought I saw one recently where I couldn't sign up. Maybe I just, maybe it was on the calendar and I saw it, it was a couple weeks out. Yeah, maybe on the calendar because once it's on there, then it's, but every other, every event should be available to sign up until the day before. Okay. And it shuts off the day before just so that people don't have same day signups because they're planning on, you know, what, who's coming by that time. And I do know there are a couple of times I have seen events that I was interested in that were sold out. Yeah. But you couldn't join the waitlist. Sometimes, I've run into that in the past. Yeah. And that's another, like, you know, if you ever see that again, it's really a good idea to like try to contact the committee chair just because that shouldn't be the case. Okay. So, we're finding there's sometimes just like mistakes that happen we're trying to like capture those mistakes so that, you know, there's a lot of hands in this stew that we make. Sure. The other thing I wanted to ask you about was, now I can't remember what it was. Oh, when you're on the website, and you're trying to find like what things that you've signed up for. How do you find that experience? Have you figured that part out? No, I actually haven't. Yeah. I look at my emails to see what I've signed up for. I do notice that on the app it's flagged for me so that's much easier. Yes, yes. I think that's true and there is a way on the website but it's like, you would never guess it. Right, I definitely, I'm not aware of it. Yeah. I always have like, I think I signed up for that so I'd either look at the event or I go back to my email to see if I had signed up. Okay, that's good to know. Have you ever tried to do anything else like, have you been on a committee where you've had to like look up how to do something or how to get reimbursed for something? No. You had to do that this year? No. What other kind of information is on there that you might have tried to look at? I've looked at members occasionally. That's a good one. Because I like, I did a, the Mahjong class and I couldn't remember like all the people's names so I went and looked, I went back to look at the event and who had signed up and then I looked at their profile just to make sure I remembered who they were. So I have used that on occasion. So I feel like that's pretty easy to use. Yeah. Because you can find somebody's email or their phone number. But there's no alumni, right? Alumni are in there, they just don't show in the directory. They're still in there but they, once they graduate, they don't show. So is that something that you would be interested in seeing, like alumni members? Well, the reason I thought of that is remember I text you and asked you if you had Tara's contact information? Right. I actually looked on the website to see if I could get it first. Yeah. And I couldn't find it so that's why I messaged you. I think that's interesting because there's an option for alumni to receive emails and I think that's just like for when there's an alumni event or something that we can then like, through the system, send them an email. But yeah, I would be wondering if alumni would be, when they graduate, we ask them certain things like, do you want to be on the alumni mailing list? But it could be interesting if we ask them, do you want to be visible in the directory? Right, because people might have met them. How do they find each other after they're done? Exactly. I think that would be helpful because what if you're like with me, I wanted to connect with Tara and I couldn't figure out her contact information. Yeah. Probably like the same like with Debbie Rhodes, you know, like actually Debbie's, but there are some people who I've gotten to know and I, you know, might want to reach out to that. You may not know that like in advance, right? Right. So I know in the e-news every month at the end of the month, we do a thing that says, you know, these people are going to be graduating next month. So like, if you want to stay in touch with them, make sure you grab their details so that you can connect with them because they won't be in the directory anymore. Right. But like, how do you know, like, you know, today that like in three weeks from now, you'll connect with a newcomer who just timed out and but now you can't look them up. Right. Yep. Yeah, I think that people might like that. I don't know that it's a question that people might want to continue to be. Right, like have the option to have your contact information available. Yeah, yeah. For, for, for both sides. Right. And because it's not like they're not there, they're there. It's just a matter of choosing some sort of option to make it visible. Who, you know, that's a good one. It's a good one. What else if I don't know if you've done this, but like if you were interested in like you are now so you're interested in thinking about your options for third year and more things are being coming more involved because now you have more time. Have you looked at all around to see how to find out more about that. Not too recently, I have looked on occasion to see what committees are active, and then you have in the committee committees to I have in the past looked at that. I haven't recently. Yeah. So there is that information there so I guess that would be one way to do it I don't know, there isn't information as far as I know about like board positions. More information about that, or I don't know. Yeah, I think we might want to include that would be to, to fix this problem of like, you know, the revolving door, you know, how do we sort of put more of that out there. I think committee names are out there but I don't know that there's any job description for board positions out there. No, I don't think so. Yeah. And it's hard to kind of say yes I'd be interested in some kind of position without really knowing what it is I mean you wouldn't do that for. Yeah, exactly. The vacancy is like and who's in it so that you can tag them and some, you know, and find out more about it. And also I think like maybe at some point in the term, you know, it would be interesting for certain committees to like the committee chairs to say like whether or not they intend to stay or whether this chair position will be open. Next term, you know, maybe there should be like, you know, a section or a page or a link to something that describes the positions describes what the board does all the different positions. process for, you know, once you're coming to the end of like that six months section session, how you approach people, you know, I know you have the dot wine and dine and sign or whatever the slip and sign thing and then, you know, there is a nominating committee, and I think what they do is just really kind of know, you know, it's but it's not that many people to maybe like six people who are on the nominating committee and they really just have to like shake the bushes trying to find people, and it's always going to be people that they've already encountered somehow. Right. I think if you had something, a section on the website that address that all the positions with with a description and the process and what's involved in the roles, it's a whole lot easier to read a document like that and have an idea, then to go to, you know, the sip and sign in. Yeah, as someone just say, do you want to share this. Right. Did you like I know that Steve sent out an email recently about like board positions coming open and just saying like you know we know some people but we don't know everybody and if you happen to be someone we don't know who might be interested, then, you know, you can, you can call me and talk to me, Steve says, or he's I think he said, if you're interested in committee reach out to that committee chair. Yeah, I just think it'd be easier to have a document that you could read and have some idea what's involved before you reach out. Yeah, so I so to that. I'm thinking about this because our company. We're, we're redesigning our website too and one of the things that we have is an announcements like a bulletin board section of the website. I don't think like we have anything like that on our website, where something like this where, you know, we're starting to think about next term and chairs like the place where you could put like a, you know, news news, right, you know, current events, you know, or just club related things and I know like they do there is a place where they put you know the board meeting minutes and like there's stuff in there it's not. You have to go looking for it but I've never seen that so I'm wondering if yeah like on the front page that having like some sort of current events or announcements or a bulletin or something because then some kind would be useful. People are busy and people look at this fast and people aren't always going to go searching for information, so you need to have it readily available and accessible. Yeah. One more question about the like a news. The newsletter. It's not archived on the website. And I'm not sure like maybe how useful it is, it would be to have it archived on the website you know like as a, like a running blog, right. Do you think because it's now if you get the email it's just in your email and if you wanted to go look at them, you'd have to go look at your old email. Do you think that you want to do that on the website. I feel like that would be consistent with what most businesses do what most everything else does. Yeah, that probably makes sense to always have a running record and not have to go back to an email. Yeah, especially because I saw every now and then someone will say I don't get the email, you know, because maybe it went to their spam or something and they don't have any other recourse, you know, to see it. Granted, the information in there is perishable, because, you know, it's about. Right, new events, you know, there's only good for a week for like documentation is good, and what you've sent out, and sometimes we feature, you know, we feature a volunteer organization or we feature some kind of like thing that's happening in the community or something like that, that you would be able to reference. I don't know I think that would be something helpful. I don't know how often it'd be used but I think it's good to archive things. Yeah, yeah. Is there anything else that you've experienced any frustrations or like happy things. I will say, yeah, the app is better too because I when you can't get any of that extra information from there just it's right. But when you pay for an event on the website you have to go through the pictures and, you know, like match, make sure you're human. Yeah, the pictures and sometimes you have to do it a second time, where you don't have to do any of that with the app. Mm hmm. So I know it's a security feature but it definitely is so much slower than doing it on the app. Yeah, that made me I don't know why because you know the information is already populated everywhere your credit card, all that. Oh, I am really much faster on the app and less steps to go through. Have you ever had to cancel an event and tell me about what happened then, like, I did not experience was you never had to do that. Well, you know, I remember one time way back in the beginning, I had to. I canceled something and I was supposed to get and I didn't get a refund. So it was a big deal but I was actually told, Oh, you'll get a check in the mail. I think I actually mentioned that to you. Yeah. And I never did. I mean, I was like, why would I get a check in the mail that just seems like so archaic but I think you said they don't do that but so I did. I never got a refund but it wasn't a big deal. Yeah, I find that I think that there's not a good connection between like when you like if you once you get an event like if you're in your app like you can't go to your event and then I think guess there is a, I have, I'm not don't have my phone but on the app. If you're looking at an event you have ticketed I wonder if there is a link to the committee chair, because you're supposed to contact the committee right. Right. I remember when I did it I contacted the committee chair, they actually had a substitute for me because it was. And, you know, I spoke with him and he said, Oh, we'll refund your money we already have somebody on the waitlist. Yeah, it just never happened. It didn't happen but that was that should have happened. But yeah, just that interface for that activity, I feel like is a little clunky. I ended up having an email exchange with the committee chair. Yeah. After the fact so I'm guessing you're right it's kind of clunky because why did we have to have inner, like have your email follow up. If I canceled on the. Yeah, there should just be a way to should have just been processed. Yeah, if you sign up for an event there should be a way to like cancel your event, even if you're not getting a refund, because it's not full like still like there should be a way to automate that somehow.  Like, click here I think one time I went on the event and it said click here to contact this committee. And when I clicked it it took me to the page with all the committees on it and then I had to like scroll down and find the committee and then find the right, you know, I could have done that myself. Thank you. It should have a cancel button. Should have a cancel.   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting, or like just some easier way to like streamline that process. Right. All right, well thank you for your time. Sure. Rainy day. Anyway, thank you and I'll let you know like kind of how this rolls out. And yeah, questions about any of those other roles if I hear of things that I think that might be interesting for you, because there's lots of ways to do something that's not so like I drag, you know, yeah, that's kind of fun, it's crucial because every little piece is, is important, you know, and having someone different in there is great and having someone who like can, you know, knows how to organize things knows how to get things done. You know, that's always a good thing. Yeah, if you get your third year out of it and so much the better. Yeah, yeah. Okay, well thank you. You're welcome. See you later. Okay, bye bye. Bye.
