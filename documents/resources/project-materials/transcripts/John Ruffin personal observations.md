John Ruffin, board member, Newcomers Club, parliamentarian, and this is my own interview about the website. So let me just kind of ramble through some of these observations. First of all, I think just the general appearance of the website is not pleasing. There's this one banner that goes across the top, this thin banner that has a picture of the beach, dusk, and a lifeguard station, doesn't really represent the beauty of Santa Barbara. I think that we should have something a lot larger and much more representative of the gorgeous nature of Santa Barbara. This could be any place, and quite frankly, the picture of any place isn't attractive at all. So the appearance of the site needs to be improved. I think it's just, my observation is that the website is clunky, it's out of date in terms of navigation and facility of moving through. The drop-downs that go across the top about events, why newcomers, committees, directories, members, gallery, and then three little lines that are volunteer and contact us. These need to be revised. Some of them are tremendously redundant, about, for instance, has the purpose and membership and activities, and yet also, why newcomers, the next drop-down has about and why join, so there's a redundancy there. It has upcoming events and member exclusive events, well it's not so much about why newcomers seems to be, for instance, kind of an ineffective title for the drop-down. I'm thinking, I need to brainstorm what might be more appropriate, you know, newcomers offers, you know, that sort of thing. Committees, the committees drop-down, well, there's a listing of committees and at the top there's a series of bullets which, if you go through each one of the bullets, has a one photo of something, I'm looking at the 20 to 40s newcomers, the afternoon book club, some that don't seem to be particularly representative of what actually goes on in the committee. Not bad, but I was just thinking in terms of how the committees are represented, it could be a lot better. There's a listing of the committees, all, whatever, 30 of them, with a link to the email address for the committee, I guess, co-chairs. It's redundant to, if you go to directories, directories also has a committee's listing, it's the same committee's listing, and yet in this case, it also has the chairs. Somehow we need to combine or reduce the amount of information because it's redundant, repeating the same description of the committees. Events, the events drop-down, I skipped over that. Upcoming open events, I think that's great, in some cases it's limited, it might be something like upcoming opening events, so that we would know, like what we've got from the Sunday Newsletter that would be the ones that are opening, as well as maybe another column that is just the ones that are most immediate. The activities, again, is a listing of the committees, and so that little box, the three-part box, activities, events calendar, and FAQs, frequently asked questions. The events calendar takes you to the, literally, the calendar version, and yet the frequently asked questions is minimal. It's basically the same thing as about newcomers, or why newcomers, is it a good fit, am I eligible to join? There's only five questions, that's hardly representative of frequently asked questions, which is, if I'm not a member, or if I want a guest to join, etc., I mean, how can we improve the FAQs to be more representative? That seems like, kind of, like, so, it's so minimal. Directories, well, what does directories mean? Well, we get the members directory, newbies directory, officers and board members, and committee chairs. Well, there's committees again, and it's the same, so that's a third redundancy of the listing of what the committees are, and now we've got the committee chairs, as well, in this case. So, members directory, and members directory is good because you can type in, you know, whoever's name and find them. However, then the next drop-down is titled members. Well, if I was looking for a member, I would probably go to members first, rather than directories. And then the members, the drop-down, is a mishmash of stuff, which is not representative of members, necessarily. Application for third year, member information, how-to's, things you need to know, guides. It's a listing when you drop that down, a listing of ten policies and basic principles you should know. Holy smokes, that probably should be under frequently asked questions. New member orientation, there's a whole lot of stuff there, instructional videos, a whole lot of stuff there that, frankly, I've never seen, I've never gone through in detail, because you wouldn't have guessed it just under member information, which is kind of nondescriptive. Join a committee, again, listing of what the committees are, redundancy again, how can we do this whole committee description better? Club reports, well, club reports, okay, so there's meeting minutes, resource not found, so that's not there. If you go to financials, there are financials, the financial, the current year is only 2024, and it's got every month financial and treasury report, overkill, why would anybody want that? That's a total waste of time, seems like, and then, let's see, let's get back to, so that's the only thing we have under club reports, and if you go to the agenda under club reports, also, you get resource not found, so there's nothing there, and then, the, you know, a significantly important, that ought to have its own drop-down is governing documents. All of the stuff, bylaws, policies, cannabis, social media, that probably ought to have its own drop-down, you know, governing documents, so people can know, you know, what are the bylaws, what are the things that I actually checked that box on the, when I was signing up, that I didn't read, and if I'm hosting an event, or if I'm opening up my house, what else do I need to know? And then officer descriptions, so there ought to be a much better drop-down title, you know, key documents and officers, officers, key governing documents and officers, something like that, because just under members, it doesn't do it, you never find that, and the truth is, most members don't ever do this kind of search, so part of the question is, why is it there anyway, but it should be, and then, under the three little boxes, three little lines, volunteer and contact us, they don't always work very well, to be able to bring things up, so they don't, they're not very functional, but if you look for volunteer opportunities, Santa Barbara Newcomb volunteer opportunities, it's organized by, alphabetically, by the organization, as opposed to the type of volunteer, so for instance, it starts off with hunger, you get Adam's Angels, arts and culture, well, there's five different references to arts and culture, mixed around through there, elderly, there's four or five different references to elderly, but in different locations, hunger shows up again, and a food bank, but if you're interested in hunger, why wouldn't they be organized under, all of them under hunger, instead of alphabetically by the organization itself, it doesn't make any sense, it's inefficient and ineffective, under the contact us, basically, the first thing you see is your own profile, it's update your own profile, alumni and non-member, email, sign up, and it's not a, it's contact, follow me if you have membership questions, and just down at the bottom is mailing address, that seems to be totally haphazard and ineffective, the contact us, often the contact would have, you know, start with address, phone number, and say, you know, there's nobody that's going to pick up the phone, but if you want to talk to specific committees, so the organization of the drop-downs is ineffective, and it just seems like it was done haphazardly or over time, a great opportunity, events, and this has been mentioned by numerous ones, when you click on events, you get upcoming events, which is that list or the events calendar, the events calendar being one of the three boxes on the right, because you kind of got to know to click on that, and then you get the calendar version, and quite frankly, most of the people I've talked to said they prefer this, the list view anyway, well, that's great, I love the list view, and it's usually true for me, if you click on the list view, it doesn't start in the current month, matter of fact, it starts in August, upcoming events in August, so it makes no sense that it starts that far back, and then it begins to pick up. Clicking on a list view will take you to the site, and often, if you want to get back out of that, and you want to get back to the calendar, you'd like to get back to the list view, but if you hit calendar all event, it takes you back to the calendar version, and actually takes you back to kind of a strange layout of the calendar, with a whole lot of horizontal lines, which don't seem to make sense. So, the navigation, I've had a couple of people mention this, the navigation between the calendar view and the list view is very clunky, and not intuitive, not very effective intuitive. So, I think those are some key elements. Occasionally, the registration process is, and I'm looking at list view, which is still in August, it seems to be kind of out of whack, but the functioning of the registration process is occasionally out of whack, in the sense that an event that has not happened, and is not even about to happen in the next week, will have registration closed, as opposed to waitlist, and this should be some rationale between whether to have waitlist, or registration closed, and that seems to be, I don't understand what the difference is between those, and why in some cases it would be closed. I've had some of my own events that I was the host for, show up with registration closed a week before the event, and had to go back into the posters of the VPs of activities to get them to open it back up again. So, I don't know, that's probably not a website issue, but in any event. So, there we are. Those are my thoughts. This is John Ruffin. Looking forward to the meeting. Thanks. Hope this is helpful. Bye.
