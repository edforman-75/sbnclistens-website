So, how long have you been a member and what was your experience? Joined in June and used... I find the website a little cumbersome. I would love to be able to go on and once you log in, then it sends you right to your page where these are the things you've signed up for and upcoming events for you. And from there, if it was easy to navigate to... And these are open events that are coming up. So, those seem like the two reasons that I would visit the website. One, to review what I've signed up for and the second to what's coming up that I can still sign up for. So, if it was... And then on the Apricot app, that's a little easier, I think. But when I'm home, I tend to sit at my computer and use the website. But overall, it's amazing what Newcomers does. And what about when you signed up? How was that experience? I remember that being fairly painless. I think there were some early on things that we missed because it just wasn't clear that, oh, it's valuable to attend the meet and greet or it's valuable to attend some of the other things. That we just kind of looked for things that were of interest to us and started going to those. So, nobody guided you in terms of what would be really valuable at the beginning? No. Okay. No, but thank you. Overall, it's wonderful. Okay. Anything else that you want to put us in? No, I think that's it. Great. Well, thank you so much.",
