### ⚠️ Email System Issues (OUT OF SCOPE)

- Alumni not visible in directory (may require Wild Apricot configuration beyond website scope)
- Contact committee chairs through platform (workflow issue)

### ⚠️ Training & Administrative (OUT OF SCOPE)
- Training resources for committee members (organizational, not website)

## Recommended 7-8 Pages to Fix

Based on user research and project scope, prioritize these pages:

### 1. **Events/Calendar Page** (CRITICAL)
**Fixes:**
- Add search/filter functionality by committee, date, keyword
- Add event category filters
- Show visual indicators for full/open/waitlist status
- Improve layout for easier scanning

**Why:** Most frequent pain point, affects event discovery (primary user goal)

### 2. **Member Dashboard/Profile Page** (CRITICAL)
**Fixes:**
- Show "My Registered Events" prominently
- Make upcoming events easy to find
- Add quick links to most-used functions

**Why:** Users currently can't find their registrations, rely on email

### 3. **Main Navigation (Header/Menu)** (CRITICAL)
**Fixes:**
- Simplify navigation structure
- Reduce number of top-level items
- Improve information architecture
- Add breadcrumbs to reduce backtracking

**Why:** 4 mentions of navigation difficulties, affects all pages

### 4. **Event Detail Pages** (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Fixes:**
- Clarify registration status display (open/full/waitlist)
- Improve clarity of event descriptions
- Show who's registered (if privacy settings allow)
- Make terms and conditions more readable

**Why:** Information quality issues create confusion

### 5. **Committees Page** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Fixes:**
- Rewrite committee descriptions for clarity
- Add visual organization by category
- Make it easier to understand what each committee does
- Add awareness features for specialty committees (e.g., 20-40 somethings)

**Why:** Users lack awareness and understanding of committees

### 6. **Board/About Page** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Fixes:**
- Make board member role descriptions easily accessible
- Improve findability of governance information
- Add clear descriptions of what each board role does

**Why:** Current descriptions are not obvious/accessible

### 7. **Newsletter Archive Page** (QUICK WIN)
**Fixes:**
- Create archive page for past newsletters
- Organize by date
- Make searchable if possible

**Why:** Users want to reference past information, relatively easy to implement

### 8. **Home Page** (FOUNDATIONAL)
**Fixes:**
- Ensure key tasks are easy to start from home
- Improve visual hierarchy
- Add quick access to most common needs (find events, see registrations)
- Reduce clutter

**Why:** Entry point for all users, sets tone for entire experience

## Design Principles for Fixes

Based on user research, prioritize:

### 1. **Utility Over Aesthetics**
- *"I want to do my business and I want to get out"*
- *"Cleaner, simpler, better is my approach"*
- Focus on task completion speed, not visual complexity

### 2. **Clarity Over Completeness**
- Users skip unclear terms and conditions
- Event descriptions need to be transparent and clear
- Don't hide information in nested menus

### 3. **Reduce Clicks and Backtracking**
- Most common complaint: too many steps to accomplish tasks
- Minimize navigation depth
- Remember user context (e.g., position on calendar)

### 4. **Show, Don't Make Users Search**
- Users expect to SEE their registrations, not hunt for them
- Event status should be immediately visible
- Important information should be surfaced, not buried

---

## User Goals (Jobs to be Done) - Website-Specific

**What users are trying to do ON THE WEBSITE:**

### Discovery (Most Important)
1. Find events I'm interested in by category/keyword
2. See what events are available vs. full
3. Understand what committees do
4. Browse upcoming activities

### Self-Service Management
5. See what events I've registered for
6. Check event details and who's attending
7. Access past newsletters

### Community Connection
8. Learn about board members and their roles
9. Discover committees that match my interests
10. See who else is attending events

---

## Success Metrics

**How to measure if fixes are working:**

1. **Search/Filter Usage:** Track if users are finding events via search vs. scrolling
2. **Reduced Support Emails:** Fewer "where are my registrations?" questions
3. **Navigation Path Analysis:** Less backtracking, shorter paths to goals
4. **Event Page Engagement:** More time on event pages, better understanding of status
5. **Committee Page Visits:** Increased engagement with committee information
6. **Newsletter Archive Usage:** Track if archive gets used

## Workshop Discussion Questions

**For 11/18 Workshop:**

1. **Which 7-8 pages should we prioritize?** (Use recommendation above as starting point)

2. **What are the quickest wins?** (Newsletter archive, navigation cleanup, event status clarity?)

3. **What requires more effort?** (Search/filter functionality, dashboard redesign?)

4. **Who owns what?** (Assign pages to working group members)

5. **What can be done in 2 months?** (Set realistic timeline)

6. **What gets documented for next term?** (Capture out-of-scope opportunities)
