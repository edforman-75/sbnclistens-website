**Subject:** SBNC Website Workshop (Nov 18) - Optional Pre-Work Available

---

Hi everyone,

Thanks for agreeing to help with the SBNC website workshop on **November 18th** at our home!

As mentioned, we're tackling the navigation and UX issues on the website. Our goal is ambitious but achievable: identify and fix **7-8 of the main problem pages** before the end of term.

## Optional Pre-Work (Due Nov 15)

To make our workshop time as productive as possible, **we're offering optional pre-work** that will help us hit the ground running.

**What it involves:**
- Conduct 2-3 quick 15-minute conversations with people who've used the SBNC website
- Simply ask them about their experience (we provide all the questions!)
- Record the conversation and submit via an easy online form
- Takes about 1-2 hours total

**Why it helps:**
Instead of guessing what's wrong, we'll show up knowing exactly what real users struggle with. Your interviews will directly shape which pages we prioritize and how we fix them.

**Can't do interviews?**
No problem at all! Just come on November 18th and participate in the design session. We recognize everyone has different schedules.

## Getting Started (If You Want to Help)

1. **Read the quick guide**: [ATTACH START_HERE.md]
2. **Conduct interviews**: Between now and November 15th
3. **Submit recordings**: [INSERT GOOGLE FORM LINK]

**Everything you need is in the attached guide.** It's simpler than it sounds - think friendly conversations, not formal research.

## Workshop Details

**Date:** November 18th, [YEAR]
**Time:** [TIME] (we'll send exact time shortly)

**What to bring:** Just yourself (and your findings if you did pre-work!)

- Review what we learned from user interviews

## Questions?

Just reply to this email. Looking forward to seeing you on the 18th!

Best,
Ed
