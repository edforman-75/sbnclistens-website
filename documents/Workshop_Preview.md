# What to Expect at the Workshop 🎉

After you've completed your interviews and submitted the recordings, we'll invite you to a workshop where the magic happens!

---

## What We'll Reveal

### The Patterns You Helped Discover
We'll show you themes that emerged across ALL the interviews. You'll see how that one thing someone told you showed up as a major pattern across multiple conversations.

### Your Specific Contributions
We'll highlight moments from YOUR interviews that led to key insights. You'll recognize quotes and stories from the people you talked to (anonymized, of course).

### Surprising "Aha!" Moments  
There are always insights that nobody expected. We'll reveal the hidden truths that only emerged when we analyzed all the conversations together.

### Real Recommendations
Based on what we learned from your interviews, we'll present actual, actionable recommendations for improving the SBNC website. These aren't guesses - they're directly based on what real users told you.

## Why It's Fun

**You'll experience the "reveal"** - Like watching a mystery solved, you'll see how individual stories connect into a bigger picture.

**You'll see your impact** - "Wait, that one comment Maria made to me became a whole theme?"

**You'll learn a new skill** - Understanding how Design Thinking works by experiencing it firsthand.

**You'll get the context** - All those questions in the interview guide? You'll understand WHY they matter.

## What You'll Learn About Design Thinking

### During the Interviews (Your Part)
- **Empathize**: You learned to really listen without judging
- **Ask**: You practiced asking "why" to go deeper
- **Observe**: You noticed emotions and patterns as they emerged

### At the Workshop (What We'll Show You)
- **Define**: How we turned stories into problem statements
- **Insight**: How patterns revealed underlying needs
- **Solutions**: How real user feedback leads to actual improvements

By experiencing Step 1 (Empathize) hands-on and then seeing Steps 2-3 (Define & Insight) in action, you'll understand the entire Design Thinking approach - not from a textbook, but from doing it!

## What People Usually Say After

*"I can't believe that small comment turned into such a big insight!"*

*"This makes so much sense now - I see why those interview questions mattered."*

*"I'm going to use this listening approach in my regular life."*

*"It's wild how our separate conversations all pointed to the same issues."*

*"I feel like I was part of something that will actually make a difference."*

## Why This Approach Works

Traditional methods: Survey 100 people, get superficial answers, guess at solutions.

Design Thinking: Talk deeply with 10-15 people, understand their real experiences, design solutions that actually address their needs.

**Your interviews are the foundation for everything.** Without your careful listening and curious questions, we'd just be guessing. With them, we have real insights that lead to real improvements.
