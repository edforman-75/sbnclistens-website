## Before the Interview

### Choose Your Recording Method

**Option 1: Phone Voice Memo (Easiest)**
- iPhone: Use built-in Voice Memos app
- Android: Use built-in Voice Recorder or download "Easy Voice Recorder"
- **Pro**: Simple, works offline, good audio quality
- **Con**: Need to be close to phone for good audio

**Option 2: Zoom or Video Call (For Remote Interviews)**
- Start a Zoom meeting and click "Record"
- **Pro**: Automatic, works for remote interviews, records video
- **Con**: Requires internet, larger file size

**Option 3: Computer Voice Recorder**
- Mac: QuickTime Player (File > New Audio Recording)
- PC: Windows Voice Recorder app
- **Pro**: Good for in-person if you have laptop present
- **Con**: Need to have computer with you

### Test Your Setup (5 minutes before)

1. **Record a 30-second test** with a friend or yourself
2. **Play it back** - can you hear clearly?
3. **Adjust placement** if needed (6-12 inches from speaker is ideal)
4. **Check storage space** - you'll need about 15-30 MB for 15 minutes

## Getting Consent

### What to Say

Use the consent script from the interview guide:

"I'd like to record our conversation so that we can transcribe it and review your feedback accurately. The recording will only be used by our website improvement team to analyze themes and patterns across multiple interviews. Your name won't be attached to specific quotes we use, and the recording will be kept confidential. **Is it okay with you if I record this conversation?**"

### Wait for Clear Verbal "Yes"

- ✅ "Yes, that's fine"
- ✅ "Sure, go ahead"  
- ✅ "Okay"
- ⚠️ "I guess so..." (Ask: "Are you comfortable with that? It's totally fine if you'd prefer I just take notes instead.")
- ❌ "I'd rather not" (Respect this! Say: "No problem at all. I'll take notes instead.")

**If they decline**: That's okay! Take written notes during the interview instead. Focus on key quotes and stories.

## During the Interview

### Recording Checklist

- [ ] Phone/device is on silent (but recording app is still running!)
- [ ] Recording device is placed between you and interviewee
- [ ] Check that recording is still going at the 5-minute mark (quick glance)
- [ ] Keep device plugged in if possible (for longer interviews)

### If Recording Fails Mid-Interview

**Don't panic!** Simply:
1. Note the time where recording stopped
2. Start a new recording
3. Continue the interview naturally
4. Send both files and note: "Recording split at X minutes due to technical issue"

## After the Interview

### Immediately After

1. **STOP the recording** (don't forget this step!)
2. **Listen to the first 10 seconds** to confirm it recorded
3. **Save/name the file immediately**: SBNC_Interview_[FirstName]_[Date]
   - Example: SBNC_Interview_Maria_Nov15.m4a

### File Naming Format

## Troubleshooting

### "The audio quality is poor/mumbly"

**Prevention**:
- Place recording device 6-12 inches from speaker
- Choose a quiet location
- Close windows, turn off fans/AC if possible
- Speak clearly and at normal volume

**If it happens**: Note in the submission form: "Some audio quality issues due to [background noise/distance/etc.]" - We can still work with it!

### "I forgot to hit record!"

**Don't tell the interviewee.** Simply:
1. Start recording immediately  
2. After the interview, write more detailed notes than usual
3. Include in submission: "Recording started X minutes into interview, first section captured from notes"

### "My phone died mid-interview"

1. Continue interview without recording
2. Take detailed written notes
3. Immediately after, write down everything you remember
4. Submit notes instead of recording - that's okay!

### "The file is too large to send"

**For very large files:**
- Use a free file transfer service like WeTransfer.com
- Upload to Google Drive and share link
- Contact team for alternative upload method
