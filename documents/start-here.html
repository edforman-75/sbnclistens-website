        <h1>👂 SBNC Listens - START HERE</h1>
    </div>

    <h2>Welcome to SBNC Listens!</h2>
    <p>We're listening to our members to improve the website. You're helping prepare for the November 18th workshop where we'll fix 7-8 critical pages before term ends.</p>

    <h2>What is This?</h2>
    <p>Optional pre-work: Conduct 2-3 friendly 15-minute interviews with people who've used the SBNC website. It's actually fun - people enjoy sharing their experiences!</p>

    <h2>The Simple Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Read the guides</strong> (30 min) - You're doing this now!</li>
        <li><strong>Check who's already being interviewed</strong> - View the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJaoHTKC3GE2YDyUaihDQc5By6OfpLnHk4pLScbllSU/edit?resourcekey=&gid=1738229324#gid=1738229324" target="_blank">tracking list</a> to avoid duplicates, then <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdeOpZGSHKjko7SlaPAvGa3akEewIyiajXZpUMwgLSrmXFntg/viewform" target="_blank">register your interviewees</a></li>
        <li><strong>Find 2-3 people</strong> - Recent members, inactive members, former members (who aren't already on the list!)</li>
        <li><strong>Record conversations</strong> (15 min each) - Just press record and chat</li>
        <li><strong>Submit online</strong> (3 min each) - Drag, drop, done</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Who Should You Talk To?</h2>
    <p>Anyone who's encountered the SBNC website! Try to get variety:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Someone thinking about joining</li>
        <li>Recent members (joined in last 6-12 months)</li>
        <li>Active current members</li>
        <li><strong>CRITICAL: Inactive current members</strong> (Why aren't they engaged?)</li>
        <li><strong>Former members</strong> (Why did they leave?)</li>
        <li>Mix of ages</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>IMPORTANT: Don't just interview super-engaged members!</h3>
        <p>The most valuable insights come from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People who joined but aren't very active</li>
            <li>People who attended once and didn't return</li>
            <li>People who browse website but rarely attend</li>
            <li>Former members who let membership lapse</li>
            <li>People who considered joining but didn't</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong> Highly engaged members figured out workarounds - they won't tell us what's broken!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Only 3 Things You Really Need to Remember</h2>

    <h3>1. Ask First, Then Record 🎙️</h3>
    <p>Use the script in the guide to get permission. It's just polite!</p>

    <h3>2. Let Them Talk 💬</h3>
    <p>You talk 20%. They talk 80%. Your job is mostly nodding and asking "why?" and "tell me more."</p>

    <h3>3. Submit via Online Form 📤</h3>
    <p>After each interview, upload your recording and answer 3 quick questions. Takes 3 minutes.</p>

    <h2>What Makes This Pre-Work Valuable</h2>
    <div class="success-box">
        <ul>
            <li>✅ You're learning a useful skill</li>
            <li>✅ No analysis required</li>
            <li>✅ Short time commitment (1-2 hours total)</li>
            <li>✅ Flexible timing</li>
            <li>✅ Real impact</li>
            <li>✅ Completely optional</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What Happens at the Workshop (November 18th)</h2>
    <p>Because we're on a tight timeline, we're doing abbreviated Design Thinking:</p>
    <p><strong>When you arrive:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Reveal</strong> (30 min) - We show what interviews uncovered</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize</strong> (20 min) - Agree on 7-8 pages to fix</li>
        <li><strong>Design Solutions</strong> (60-90 min) - Sketch improvements in groups</li>
        <li><strong>Plan Implementation</strong> (30 min) - Who codes what, by when</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>You'll walk away with:</strong> Clear plan to fix 7-8 pages based on real user feedback.</p>

    <h2>Relax! You're NOT Doing:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>❌ Writing reports</li>
        <li>❌ Finding patterns</li>
        <li>❌ Being a website expert</li>
        <li>❌ Memorizing questions</li>
        <li>❌ Being perfect</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>You ARE doing:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Having interesting conversations</li>
        <li>✅ Being genuinely curious</li>
        <li>✅ Pressing record and stop</li>
        <li>✅ Contributing to improvements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ready? Your Path Forward:</h2>
