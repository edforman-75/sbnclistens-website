      <h2>1. Purpose and Audience</h2>
      <p>
        This page explains how the main Wild Apricot (WA) data objects relate to each other,
        which objects are available via the WA API, and how SBNC extends this model to
        represent <strong>committees</strong> and <strong>leadership roles</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>It is intended for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designers and developers working on SBNC&rsquo;s WA customizations.</li>
        <li>Volunteers configuring widgets, pages, and automation (API, Make-style tools).</li>
        <li>Future admins who need to understand where committee and role data actually lives.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal is not to cover every WA entity, but to focus on the objects SBNC actually uses
        and extends.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>2. Core Wild Apricot Objects We Rely On</h2>

      <p>
        At SBNC, most of our workflows center around a few key WA object types. Below is a
        simplified list, with notes about how we use them and whether they are exposed via
        the official WA API.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Contacts &amp; Members</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contacts</strong> are the base records for people in the database
          (email, name, address, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Members</strong> are contacts who currently hold a membership level.
        </li>
        <li>
          SBNC uses <strong>custom fields on contacts/members</strong> heavily to track:
          <ul>
            <li>Leadership roles (e.g., President, VP Activities, Committee Chair).</li>
            <li>Committee affiliations and responsibilities.</li>
            <li>Internal flags that drive permissions and internal workflows.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API:</strong> Contacts and Members are available via the WA API, including
          custom fields (subject to API permissions).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Membership Levels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Membership levels define the type of relationship a member has with SBNC
          (e.g., Newcomer, Extended Newcomer, Admin, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          SBNC sometimes uses membership levels as <strong>role buckets</strong>, where
          a specific level implies broader privileges or responsibilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API:</strong> Membership levels are readable via the WA API and can be
          used to filter members and drive automations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 Events &amp; Registrations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Events</strong> are used both for actual SBNC activities and, in some cases,
          as <strong>pseudo-events</strong> that encode internal structures (e.g., committees).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Registrations</strong> represent people signed up for an event.
        </li>
        <li>
          SBNC uses registrations on pseudo-events to represent committee membership
          (more on this below).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API:</strong> Events and Registrations are available via the API, including
          event categories, registration types, and custom fields.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 Financial Objects (Invoices, Payments, Donations)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          WA tracks <strong>invoices</strong>, <strong>payments</strong>, and
          <strong>donations</strong>, usually tied to either memberships or events.
        </li>
        <li>
          SBNC primarily uses these for standard membership and event payments,
          not for committee modeling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API:</strong> Financial objects are partially exposed via the API
          (details depend on WA plan and permissions).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.5 Website Content (Pages, Menus, Gadgets)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Public and member-facing pages, navigation, and gadgets form the surface layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          From a data-model perspective, pages and gadgets <em>display</em> data from the
          objects above; they do not store core member or committee data themselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API:</strong> Page content is not exposed as structured objects through
          the standard WA API. Custom integrations are usually built <em>around</em> pages,
          not <em>through</em> them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>3. How These Objects Relate</h2>

      <p>
        The diagram below shows the main relationships SBNC cares about, focusing on
        members, events, and the financial trail.
      </p>

      <pre class="data-diagram"><code>                +--------------------+
                |  Membership Level  |
                +--------------------+
                          ^
                          | (has level)
                          |
+-----------------+       |
|   Contact       |-------+
| / Member        |
+-----------------+
        |
        | (registers for)
        v
+-----------------+          +--------------------+
|     Event       |&lt;---------| Event Category     |
+-----------------+          +--------------------+
        |
        | (creates)
        v
+-----------------+      +----------------------+
|  Registration   |-----&gt;| Invoice / Payment    |
+-----------------+      +----------------------+
</code></pre>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>Contact/Member</strong> belongs to exactly one
          <strong>Membership Level</strong> at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members can register for many <strong>Events</strong>; each registration may
          generate invoices and payments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Event Categories</strong> group events for calendar views and filtering.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        SBNC&rsquo;s committee and role modeling builds on top of this structure rather than
        introducing new native objects.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>4. API Accessibility and Why It Matters</h2>

      <p>
        For SBNC&rsquo;s automation (including potential use of the WA API, Make, or similar
        tools), it is important to know which objects can be queried programmatically.
      </p>

      <h3>4.1 High-level API view</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contacts/Members:</strong> API-readable and updatable, including custom fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Membership Levels:</strong> API-readable; can be used for filtering and logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Events &amp; Registrations:</strong> API-readable; core for automation around attendance and committee pseudo-events.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Records (Invoices/Payments/Donations):</strong> Partially API-readable; used mainly for reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Pages, menus, and widgets:</strong> <em>Not</em> first-class API objects; usually managed via the admin UI.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Practical implications for SBNC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Anything we want to automate (e.g., leadership rosters, committee lists, special emails)
          should be represented through <strong>API-visible objects</strong> like:
          <ul>
            <li>Custom contact/member fields</li>
            <li>Events and registrations</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Design decisions that rely heavily on page structure or theme markup are
          <strong>harder to automate</strong>, because those are not API-first.
        </li>
        <li>
          For new customizations, we get more long-term leverage by modeling data in
          contacts/members and events, with pages acting as views on that data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. SBNC Extensions: Roles and Committees</h2>

      <p>
        Wild Apricot does <strong>not</strong> have native objects for
        &ldquo;Committee&rdquo; or &ldquo;Leadership Role.&rdquo; SBNC models these concepts
        using a combination of membership levels, custom fields, and special events.
      </p>

      <h3>5.1 Roles via Membership Levels and Custom Fields</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some roles are represented as <strong>membership levels</strong>
          (for example, admin-level memberships that imply broader access).
        </li>
        <li>
          More granular roles (e.g., &ldquo;VP Activities,&rdquo; &ldquo;Event Chair,&rdquo;
          &ldquo;Tech Committee Member&rdquo;) are modeled via
          <strong>custom fields on the contact/member record</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          These custom fields answer questions such as:
          <ul>
            <li>What leadership role(s) does this member hold?</li>
            <li>Which committee(s) is this member part of?</li>
            <li>What is their primary responsibility?</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Because these are contact/member fields, they are
          <strong>API-accessible</strong>, which allows automated exports, dashboards,
          and roster pages.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.2 Committees via Pseudo-Events and Registrations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each committee is represented by a <strong>special event</strong>
          (sometimes called a pseudo-event).
        </li>
        <li>
          The members of a committee are stored as
          <strong>registrants on that pseudo-event</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          This lets SBNC reuse WA&rsquo;s built-in registration UI and API to:
          <ul>
            <li>Maintain committee rosters.</li>
            <li>Track join/leaving dates via registration history.</li>
            <li>Drive automated communications based on committee membership.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Important:</strong> These pseudo-events must be kept out of public
          calendars and event listings. At the moment, SBNC needs to
          <strong>double-check how this is configured</strong> (categories, visibility
          settings, or naming conventions) to ensure committee events do not appear
          inadvertently.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5.3 Combined picture</h3>
      <p>
        Putting this together, an SBNC committee member might be represented as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <strong>Contact/Member</strong> with:
          <ul>
            <li>A standard SBNC membership level (e.g., Newcomer, Extended Newcomer).</li>
            <li>Custom fields indicating current role(s) and committee(s).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          One or more <strong>registrations</strong> on committee pseudo-events,
          providing a roster and history for that committee.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This modeling approach is powerful but also introduces complexity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Committee membership is <strong>split</strong> between:
          <ul>
            <li>Custom fields (who holds which role), and</li>
            <li>Event registrations (who is in which committee event).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Documentation and automation must treat both layers consistently, or rosters
          can drift out of sync.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>6. Design &amp; Customization Implications</h2>

      <p>
        Understanding the data model helps us decide how far to push customization and
        where to anchor new features.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Good candidates for automation:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Leadership directories built from contact custom fields.</li>
            <li>Committee pages driven by pseudo-event registrations.</li>
            <li>API-based exports and dashboards keyed off membership level and roles.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Areas to use caution:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Designs that assume committees or roles are first-class WA objects
              (they are not).
            </li>
            <li>
              Complex logic spread across both custom fields and pseudo-events
              without clear documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any change that might accidentally expose committee pseudo-events
              in public calendars or listings.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        Recommendation: When proposing new features or automations, always specify
        <strong>which WA object(s)</strong> the feature depends on
        (contacts, custom fields, events, registrations, etc.). This keeps the mental
        model clear for future SBNC volunteers and developers.
